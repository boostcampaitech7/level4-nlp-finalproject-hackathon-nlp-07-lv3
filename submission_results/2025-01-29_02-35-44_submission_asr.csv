test0000,there's iron they say in all our blood and a grain or two perhaps is good but his he makes me harshly feel has got a little too
test0001,margaret said mister hail as he returned from showing his guests downstairs i could not help watching your face with some anxiety when mister thorne made
test0002,you don't mean that you thought me so silly
test0003,i really like that account of himself better than anything else he said
test0004,his statement of having been a shop boy was the thing i like best of all
test0005,you who were always accusing people of being shabby at hillston?
test0006,i don't think mister heyl you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been
test0007,i really was very much afraid of showing him how much shocked i was at some parts of what he said
test0008,his father dying in miserable circumstances
test0009,why it might have been in the workhouse
test0010,his father speculated wildly failed and then killed himself because he could not bear the disgrace
test0011,all his former friends shrunk from the disclosures that had to be made of his dishonest gambling wild hopeless struggles made with other people's money to regain his
test0012,no one came forth to help the mother and this boy
test0013,at least no friend came forward immediately and miss thauton is not one i fancy to wait till tarry kindness comes to find her out
test0014,so they left mutton
test0015,how taint'd asked father
test0016,oh papa by that testing everything by the standard of wealth
test0017,when he spoke of the mechanical powers he evidently looked upon them only as new ways of extending trade and making money
test0018,and the poor men around him they were poor because they were vicious out of the pale of his sympathies because they had not his own nature and the
test0019,not vicious he never said that
test0020,in providence and self indulgence were his words
test0021,margaret was collecting her mother's working materials and preparing to go to bed
test0022,just as she was leaving the room she hesitated she was inclined to make an acknowledgement which she thought would please her father but which to be full and
test0023,however out it came
test0024,papa i do think mr thorton a very remarkable man but personally i don't like him at all
test0025,and i do said her father laughing.
test0026,personally as you call it and all
test0027,i don't set him up for a hero or anything of that kind
test0028,"but goodnight, child."
test0029,there were several other signs of something wrong about missus hales
test0030,she and dickson held mysterious consultations in a bedroom from which dickson would come out crying and cross as was a custom when any distress of her mistress
test0031,once margaret had gone into the chamber soon after dickens left it and found her mother on her knees and as margaret stole out she caught a
test0032,but though she received caresses and fond words back again in such profusion as would have gladdened her formerly yet she felt that there was a
test0033,she lay awake very long this night planning how to lessen the evil influence of their miltenstein on her mother
test0034,a servant give dickson permanent assistance should be got if she gave up the whole time to the search and then at any rate her mother might have all
test0035,visiting register offices seeing all manner of unlikely people and very few in the least likely absorbed margaret's time and thoughts for several days
test0036,one afternoon she met bessy higgins in the street and stopped to speak to her
test0037,"well, bisy, how are you?"
test0038,better and not better if you know what that means
test0039,not exactly replied margaret smiling
test0040,i'm better in not being torn to pieces by coughing nights but i'm weary and tired of milton and longing to get away to the land
test0041,margaret turned around to walk alongside of the girl in her feeble progress homewards
test0042,but for a mineral or two she did not speak
test0043,at last she said in a low voice
test0044,bessy do you wish to die?
test0045,bessie was silent in her turn for a minute or two then she replied
test0046,not worse than many others i reckon.
test0047,but what was it?
test0048,you know i'm a stranger here so perhaps i'm not so quick at understanding what you mean as if i'd lived all my life in milton
test0049,i had forgotten what i said for the time continued margaret quietly
test0050,i should have thought of it again when i was less busy may i go with you now
test0051,the sharpness in her eye turned to a wistful longing as she met margaret's soft and friendly gaze
test0052,as they turned up into a small court opening out into a squatted street bessey said
test0053,you'll not be daunted at your fathers at home and speaks a bit gruff at first
test0054,but nicholas was not at home when they entered
test0055,gasp beseech at last
test0056,bessy took a long and feevish draft and then fell back and shut her eyes
test0057,margaret bent over and said bessy don't be in pain with your life whatever it is or may have been
test0058,remember who gave it to you and made what it is
test0059,now i'll not have my wench preach too
test0060,but surely said margaret facing round you believe in what i said that god gave her life and ordered what kind of life it was to be
test0061,i believe what i see and no more
test0062,that's what i believe young woman
test0063,i don't believe all i hear no not by big deal
test0064,but who's come at last and who's welcome as long as he'll keep from preaching on what who knows not about
test0065,it's simple and not far to fetch nor hard to work
test0066,but the girl only played the more with margaret
test0067,don't think hardly on him. he's a good man he is.
test0068,i sometimes think i shall be mirthed with sorrow even in the city of god your father is not there
test0069,the feebish colour came into a chick and the feebish flame into her eye
test0070,but you'll be there father you shall oh my heart
test0071,she put her aunt in it and became ghastly pale
test0072,margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to rest upon her bosom
test0073,presently the spasm that foresaw death had passed away and bessie roused herself and said
test0074,i'll go to bed its best place but catching at margaret's gown you'll come again i know you will but just say it
test0075,i'll come to morrow said margaret
test0076,margaret went away very sad and thoughtful
test0077,she was late for tea at home
test0078,"have you met with a servant, dear?"
test0079,no ma'am that anne buckley would never have done
test0080,spose i try said mister hell
test0081,everybody else has had their turn at this great difficulty now let me try
test0082,i may be the cinderella to put on the slipper after all
test0083,"what would you do, papa? how would you set about it?"
test0084,well i would i would apply it to some good house mother to recommend me one known to herself or her servants
test0085,very good but we must first catch our house mother
test0086,"the mother of whom he spoke to us, said margaret,"
test0087,mister thornton the only mother he has i believe said mister he quietly
test0088,i shall like to see her she must be an uncommon person her mother added
test0089,perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us and be glad of our place
test0090,she sounded to be such a careful economical person that i should like any one out of the same family
test0091,my dear said mister hell alarmed pray don't go off on that idea
test0092,i'm sure at any rate she would not like strangers to know anything about it
test0093,take notice that this is not my kind of horatius papa if i have any at all which i don't agree to though you're always
test0094,i don't know positively that it is hers either but from little things i've gathered from him i fancy so
test0095,they cared too little to ask in what manner her son had spoken about her
test0096,if called to a case supposed as suspected to be one of poisoning the medical man has two duties to perform to save the patient's life and to place
test0097,he should make inquiries as to symptoms and time at which fruit or medicine was last taken
test0098,he should notice the position and temperature of the body the condition of rigor mortis marks of violence appearance of lips and mouth
test0099,in making a post mortem examination the elementary canal should be removed and preserved for further investigation
test0100,the gut and the gallbladder were cut across between these ligatures the stomach may be removed entirely without spilling its contents
test0101,if the medical practitioner is in doubt on any point he should obtain technical assistance from someone who has paid attention to the subject
test0102,in a case of attempted suicide by poisoning is it the duty of the doctor to inform the police
test0103,the bestmatic is that which is at hand
test0104,the days for an unmarried are ten minims
test0105,epomorphosis is not allied in physiological action to morphine and may be given in cases of narcotic poisoning

test0107,in using the elastic stomach tube some fluid should be introduced into the stomach before attempting to empty it or a portion of the mucous membrane may be sucked
test0108,the tube should be examined to see that it is not broken or cracked as exceptions have happened from neglecting this precaution
test0109,antidotes are usually given hyperthermically or if the mouth in the form of tablets
test0110,in the absence of the hyperbaric syringe the remedy may be given by the rectum
test0111,notice the small color and general appearance of the matter submitted for examination
test0112,for the separation of an alkaloid the following is the process of stauroto
test0113,this process is based upon the principle that the salts of the alkalies are soluble in alkaline water and insoluble in ether
test0114,the pure alcohols with the exception of morphine in its crystalline form are soluble in ether
test0115,two cool the mixture and filter wash the residue with strong alcohol and mix the filtrates
test0116,the residue may be set aside for the detection of the metallic poisons suspected expel the alcohol by careful evaporation
test0117,on the evaporation of the alcohol the winessness and fat matter separate
test0118,evaporate the filtrate to a syringe and extract with successive portions of absolute alcohol
test0119,separate the ethereal solution and rearrate
test0120,five a part of this ethereal solution is poured into a watch glass and allowed to evaporate
test0121,to purify it add a small quantity of dilute sulphuric acid and after evaporating to three quarters of its bulk add a saturated solution of
test0122,boil the finely divided substance with about one eighth its bulk of pure hydrochloric acid add from time to time potash chloride until the solids are
test0123,the residue of the material after digestion with hydrochloric acid and potassium chlorate may have to be examined for silver lead and baryum

test0126,his books told him that treasure is best hidden under loose boards and as of course your house has a secret panel which he had not
test0127,he got it up and pushed his treasures as far as he could along the rough crumbly surface of the lass and plaster
test0128,when dicky came down his aunt slapped him and he took the half penny and limped off obediently
test0129,he had never seen one before and it interested him extremely
test0130,he looked about him and knew that he did not at all know where he was

test0151,and i ask you let me come along you got that
test0152,"get a word down then, done"

test0209,they did not stay there walked out across the downs with the skylarks were singing and on a dip of the downs came upon great stone walls and
test0210,what's that there s ducky
test0211,replied he of a truth i heard him not and i want him not and folks are all sleeping
test0212,but she said whosoever thou seest awake he is the resitor
test0213,then said the unicorn are thou who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him
test0214,rejoined the young who then was the reciter point him out to me
test0215,by allah replied the farmer i tell thee the truth
test0216,tell me what happened quoth wazamakan
test0217,what else did then that thou must needs recite verses seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the folk are asleep for they require
test0218,and he also improvised the two following this stitch
test0219,when otto zalmann heard the first improvisation she called to mine father and her mother and her brother and their willow home then she we
test0220,he who recited the first time hath recited a second time and i heard him hard by
test0221,by allah and thou fech him not to me i will assuredly rouse the chamberlain on thee and he shall beat thee and cast thee
test0222,but take these hundred diners and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently and do him no hurt
test0223,return quickly and linger not
test0224,when it was the seventy third night
test0225,but the yonuk said i will not leave thee till thou show me who it was that recited the verses for i dread returned to my lady
test0226,now when the farmer heard these words he feared for zawal macan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the youth by bala
test0227,so go thou to thy station and if thou again meet any one after this hour reciting oaths whether he be near or far it will be i
test0228,then he kissed the oenok's head and spake him fair till he went away but the castro fetched around and returned secretly came and stood
test0229,i say what made my ignorance whatever the bitter cup i drain far be from me that i land to flee nor will i bow to those who blame and
test0230,then said the yukon to zawal makan peace be with thee my lord
test0231,oh my lord continue the unicorn and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
test0232,we will do thee no upright my son nor wrong thee in not but our object is that thou bend thy gracious steps with me to my mistress to
test0233,then the young went out to zawal macan and said to him recite what verses do you know for my ladies here hard by listening to
test0234,and also these
test0235,then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twain fell down in a fainting fit
test0236,when the young oak saw his case he wandered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them waited till they should recover
test0237,after a while they came to themselves and usad altasam rejoiced with exceeding joy oppression and depression left her and gladness took the mastery of
test0238,accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the can and what had happened to her with the badawi how the merchant
test0239,but now go to thy master and bring him quickly to me
test0240,the chamberlain called the castretto and charged him to do accordingly so he replied i hear and i obey and he took his pages with him and
test0241,she said it hath reached me o wise king that when the stalker girded his waist for flight and bespake himself saying oh would i
test0242,i believe he has denounced me to the yukon hence these pages at about me and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime
test0243,why did thou say i never repeated these caplets nor do i know who repeated them when it was thy companion
test0244,but now i will not leave thee between this place and bagdad and what begeth'd thy comrade shall beget thee
test0245,it was as i feared the coming of ill discerning but on to a law we are all returning
test0246,then the youngook cried upon his pages saying take him off the ass
test0247,and he answered i am the chamberlain of the emperor of damascus king sharqan song of omar bin numan lord of bagdad and
test0248,so farey forwards no harm shall befall you till you join his grand vizir danum
test0249,then he bade him be seated and questioned him and he replied that he was chamboling to the emperor of damascus and was bound to king
test0250,so it was agreed that we go to damascus and fetch thence the king's son sharakan and make him sultan over his father's realm
test0251,and amongst them were some who would have chosen the cadet zawa macan for quoth day his name be light of the place and he hath
test0252,so he turned to the vizier dan and said to him verily your tale is a wonder of wonders
test0253,know o chief vizier that here where you have encountered me allah has given you rest from fatigue and brings you you your desire after the easiest of
test0254,when the minister heard these words he rejoiced with great joy and said oh chamberlain tell me the tale of the twain and what befell them
test0255,zawa macon bowed his head a while and then said i accept the position for indeed there was no refusing and he was certified that the chamberlain
test0256,then he added oh my uncle how shall i do with my brother sharkan
test0257,after a while the dust dispersed and there appeared under it the army of bagdad and coruscan a conquering host like the pool tides sea
test0258,when it was the seventeenth night
test0259,and in it or rejoiced at the accession of the light of the place
test0260,lastly the minister went in and kissed the ground before zawal amakan who rose to meet him saying welcome o vizir and sayer's
test0261,moreover the sultan commanded his vizier danoun call at ten days halt of the army that he might be private with him and learn from him
test0262,he then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host to halt ten days
test0263,what has happened to me
test0264,he asked himself something warm and living quicken me it must be in the neighborhood
test0265,when however the ostrich was quite nigh unto them then did he hear plainly let human voice peck in the midst of the kind and apparently all
test0266,for do i hear seek
test0267,answered he the same that thou seest thou mischief maker that is to say happiness upon earth
test0268,for i tell thee that i have already talked half a morning unto them and just now were they about to give me their answer
test0269,he would not be rid of his affliction
test0270,who hath not at present his heart his mouth and his eyes full of disgust

test0278,answered the other
test0279,thou knowest it thyself better even than i
test0280,thus beg the peaceful one and puffed himself and puffed with his words so that the kind won a new
test0281,thou doest wail to thyself thou prithee on the mount and thou useth to such savey words
test0282,they also abstain from all heavy throats which inflame the heart
test0283,well
test0284,cassandros cassandros thou shouldst also see mine animals mine eagle and mine serpent their like do not at present exist on earth
test0285,and talk to mine animals of the happiness of animals

test0295,verily my folly has grown big in the mountains
test0296,now do i hear six old fools legs rattling behind one another
test0297,by dottors atuesta need to be frightened by his shadow
test0298,also me think it that after all it had long or less than mine
test0299,who where his twist scouted him with his glance he was frightened as by a sudden apparition so slender sophistry hollow and van out did his follower
test0300,as a twist of vehemence what do we stoop here
test0301,and why call this daw that i serve my shadow
test0302,thou art not pleasing unto me

test0304,o arth thou hast become to run for me
test0305,when the devil casts his skin do not his name also fall away it is also skin
test0306,the devil himself is perhaps skin
test0307,sometimes i meant to lie and behold
test0308,then only did i hate that truth
test0309,how have i still inclinations
test0310,have i still a goal
test0311,i haven't words which my sale is set
test0312,for it too i ask and seek and have sought but have not found it
test0313,oh eternal everywhere oh eternal nowhere oh eternal in vain
test0314,thou art my shadow
test0315,said he it alas sadly
test0316,thy danger is not small thou free spirit and wanderer
test0317,they sleep quietly they enjoy the new security
test0318,behave lest in the end a narrow faith capture thee a hard rigorous delusion
test0319,for now every thing that is narrow and fixed seduce it and tempted thee
test0320,thou hast lost thy goal
test0321,thou poor rover and rambler thou tired but to fly
test0322,will thou have a rest in a home this evening
test0323,once upon a time a brummie who was walking along the road came upon an iron cage in which a great tiger was shut up by the villagers
test0324,the bramah answered no i will not for if i let you out of the cage you will eat me
test0325,oh father of mercy answered to tiger in truth that i will not
test0326,i will never be so ungrateful only let me out that i may drink some water and return
test0327,then the bramman took pity on him and opened the cage door but no sooner had he turned so that the tiger jumping out said now i will
test0328,so the bramham and the tiger walked on till they came to a banan tree and the bramham said to it banan tree ban
test0329,on what must i give judgment as the barren tree
test0330,this tiger said the ramman begged me to let him out of this cage to drink a little water and he promised not to hurt me if i did
test0331,it is jealous that he should do so or no
test0332,let the tiger eat the man for men are an ungrateful race
test0333,sir camel sir camel cried the brahman hear and give judgment
test0334,at a little distance they've found a bullock lying by the road side
test0335,is it fair that he should do so or not
test0336,let the tiger eat the man for men have no pity
test0337,three out of the six and given judgment against the bramman but still he did not lose all hope and determined to as the other three
test0338,on what must i give judgment asks the devil
test0339,the bramah stated the case and the eagle answered whenever men see me they try to shoot me they climb the rocks and steal away my little ones
test0340,then the tiger began to roar and said judgment of all is against you oh bramman
test0341,after this they saw an allegator and the bramah related the matter to him hoping for a more favourable verdict
test0342,but the allegator said whenever i put my nose out of the water men taunt me and try to kill me
test0343,the bramah man gave himself up as lost but again he prayed the tiger to have patience and let him ask the opinion of the sixth judge
test0344,now the sixth was jack hawthorne
test0345,the bramah told his story and said to him uncle jackel uncle jackel say what is your judgment
test0346,show me the pace
test0347,when he got there the jackal said now bramman show me exactly where you stood
test0348,exactly there was it asked to jackaroo
test0349,exactly here replied to the brammin
test0350,where was the tiger then
test0351,why i stood so said the tiger jumping into the cage and my head was on this side
test0352,very good said to jacko but i cannot judge without understanding the whole matter exactly
test0353,shut and bolted said the bramah
test0354,then shut and bolted set the jack hold
test0355,when the brahman had turned this the jackal said oh you wicked and ungrateful tiger
test0356,when a good bramham opened your cage is to eat him the only return you would make
test0357,proceed on your journey frank ramman
test0358,your road lies that way and mind this

test0366,the absence of detailed reference to the hebrews is therefore perfectly natural
test0367,it seems probable that not all but only part of the tribes which ultimate caravans into the hebrew nation found their way to egypt
test0368,the stories regarding joseph their traditional father efrem and manasseh imply that these strong central tribes probably together with the southern tribes of benjamin and
test0369,the biblical narratives apparently disagree regarding the duration of the sojourn in egypt
test0370,the later traditions tend to extend the period
test0371,he were found several inscriptions bearing the egyptian name of the citi patam houses of the god atom
test0372,contingent in scripts and also states that he found near pithum the house of ramzes a city with the royal residences and temples
test0373,that the hebrews were assailed under this siren was naturally inevitable
test0374,was any other procedure to be spectacled from it the despotic roar of that land and bay
test0375,the making of a loyal patriot
test0376,the story of moses his birth in early childhood is one of the most interesting chapters in biblical history
test0377,which moves it justified and resists the gipsy's tax master
test0378,is penning's always disasters not only to its victims but also to the government imposing it

test0386,the story of mooses is in many ways closely parallel to that annulet
test0387,the priest the sub tribe of the cananites received him into his home and gave him his daughter in marriage
test0388,note the caricaturist oriental idea of marriages
test0389,here moses learned the lessons that were essential for his training as a leader and the deliverer of his people
test0390,after the capture of jericho certain of them went up with the southern tribes to conquer southern palastine
test0391,many modern scholars drew the conclusion from the biblical narrative that it was from the kinites that moses first learned of yahweh or as the
test0392,do the oriental seaboard traditions imply that the ancestors of the israelites were worshippers of jehovah
test0393,the title of his fundation implies that this preach ministered at some wiltonian sanctuary
test0394,moses in the home of the mendian priest was brought into direct and constant contact with the jehovah worship
test0395,the cruel fate of his people and the painful experience in egypt that had driven him into the wilderness prepared his mind to receive this training
test0396,his quest was for a jacket and strong gun able to deliver the oppressed
test0397,the wilderness with its lurking foes and the ever present dread of hunger and thirst deepens its sense of need and of dependence upon the power able to guide
test0398,the presence of the vatsantonian clay of central asia's miner still call every life giving spring god have given
test0399,the constant necessity of meeting the dangers of the wilderness and defending the flock entranced to moses care developed his courage in power of leadership in action
test0400,evidently the intention was made to make things present for the royal fool tobacco during his visit
test0401,the proboscis in the regulary's quota as a smock in saint mary's church referred it may be noted to the act which was held
test0402,sometimes tobacco is used in church for disinfecting or deodorizing purposes

test0415,parrots in that quarter where user distressed by the sips is true but the c s for them far more are innocent than are guilty of any acts
test0416,now ere after the sun he sat the wind fell to unloft air that just kept steerage way on the ship
test0417,fortunately the john was not only fat but she minded her helm as the light footed girl turns in a lively dance
test0418,i never was in a better steering slip potty spotty in moderate weather
test0419,mister marble he adored to breathe was fairly snoozing on the humpbacks being like the scales as one might say very asleep
test0420,at that moment i heard a noise we're familiar to see men that of an oar falling in the boat
test0421,anching it sail ho and close aboard
test0422,he was tims of a seam to require a second look in order to ascertain but was to be done
test0423,although they went three feet to two this gave us a moment of breathing time
test0424,as our seats were off laying forward and remained so for a few minutes it gave me a leisure to look about
test0425,i soon saw both proquets and grudgingly up was i to perceive that they had not approached materially near
test0426,mick cay deserved that so and remarked that our movements had been so prompt as to take the rascal as his back
test0427,a preface still not succeeded
test0428,the prophets did not utter the corps but nigh as fast
test0429,i heard the rattling of the boarding pails too as they were cut adrift from the spencer brook and fell upon the decks
test0430,kite went out and returned with three or four mascots and as many pips
test0431,the stillness that rang on both sides was like that of death
test0432,the jagged behaved beautifully he came ran like a cat
test0433,the question was now whether we could pass them or not before they got near up to grapple
test0434,captain behaved perfectly well in his critical instance commanding a dead silence and closing its intent to his orders
test0435,naw i'm alone bored the john was his heart
test0436,on our side we gave the gentlemen the four sixes two at the nearest and two at the sternest most pro which was still near a cable
test0437,they were like the yeas of feigned in english
test0438,i doubt if we touch the man in the nearsightedness
test0439,in that seat the ship passes ahead all of her canvas span for leaving the prow moosters in her wake
test0440,they swarmed up in front of sherburn's pales as thick as they could jam together and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise
test0441,some sung out tear down the fence tear down the fence
test0442,the stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable
test0443,sherburn ran his eye slow along the crowd and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out gaze him but they couldn't they dropped their eyes
test0444,the average men are cowardly
test0445,because they're afraid the man's friends will shoot them in the back in the dark and it's just what they would do
test0446,so they always quit and then a man goes in the night with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynch the rascal
test0447,you didn't want to come
test0448,but a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness
test0449,now leave and take your half a man with you tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this
test0450,the crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearing off every which way and buckhart he killed it after them looking tolerable chief
test0451,you can't be too careful
test0452,they argued and tried to keep him out but he wouldn't listen and a whole show came to a standstill
test0453,and one or two women begin to scream
test0454,so then the ringmaster he made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance and if the man would promise he wouldn't make
test0455,it weren't funny to me though i was all of a tremble to see his danger
test0456,and the horse are going like a house of fire to.
test0457,he shed him so thick they kindled up the air and altogether he shed seventeen suits
test0458,why it was one of his own men
test0459,and but never mind the rest of his outfit it was just wild but it was awful funny
test0460,the people most killed themselves laughing and when the king got done quipping and quipping off behind the scenes they roared and clapped and stormed and
test0461,twenty people sings out
test0462,the duke says yes
test0463,everybody sings out sold
test0464,but a big fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts hold on
test0465,just a word gentlemen they stopped to listen
test0466,what we want is to go out of here quiet and talk this show up and sell the rest of the town
test0467,you bet it is the judge is right everybody sings out
test0468,we struck the raft at the same time and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream all dark and still and edging towards the middle
test0469,we never showed a light till we was about ten miles below the village
test0470,green horns flat heads
test0471,no i say it don't
test0472,well it don't because it's in debt i reckon they're all a lot
test0473,well that's what i'm saying all kings is mostly rapscallions as far as i can make out is that so
test0474,and look at charles second and louis fourteen and louis fifteen and james second and edward second and richard third and forty more besides all those
test0475,may you see old henry the one who was in bloom he was a blossom
test0476,ring up fair rosamond
test0477,well henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country
test0478,suppose he opened his mouth what then
test0479,all i say is kings as kings and you got to make allowances
test0480,take them all around there are a mighty ornery lock it's the way they're raised
test0481,well they all do jim
test0482,now to duke he's a tolerable like the man in some ways
test0483,this one's a middle and hard lot for a duke
test0484,when i woke up just a daybreak he was sitting there with his head down bespoken his knees moaning and moaning to himself
test0485,it don't seem natural but i reckon so
test0486,he was often moaning and mourning that way nights when he judged i was asleep and saying po little lizzie
test0487,don't you hear me shut da do
test0488,i lay i make you mine
test0489,just as loud as i could yell
test0490,which was sound enough judgement but you take the average man and he wouldn't wait for him to how
test0491,the king's duds was all black and he did look real swell and starchy
test0492,why before he looked like the ornate old rip that ever was but now when he take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do
test0493,jim cleaned up the canoe and i got my paddle ready
test0494,where are you bound for young man
test0495,get aboard says the king
test0496,i did so and then we all three started on again
test0497,the young chap was mighty thankful said it was tough work touting his baggage such weather
test0498,he asked the king where he was going and the king told him he'd come down the river and landed at the other village this morning and now he
test0499,but then i say again no i reckon it ain't him or else he wouldn't be paddling up the river you ain't him are you
test0500,no my name's boycott alexander boycott reverend alexander boycott i suppose i must say as i'm one of the largest poor
test0501,you see he was pretty old and george's giers was too young to be much company for him except mary jane the red headed one and so
test0502,too bad too bad he couldn't have lived to see his brother's poor soul
test0503,i'm going in a ship next wensday for raijano where my uncle is
test0504,but it'll be lovely wished i was a going
test0505,mary jane's nine susan's fifteen joanna's about fourteen that's the one that gives herself to good works and has a hairlip poor things
test0506,well they could be worse off
test0507,old peter had friends and they ain't gonna let them come to no harm
test0508,blamed if he didn't acquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town and all about the wilks and about peter's business which was a t
test0509,when they're deep they won't stop for a hell.
test0510,was peter wilks well off
test0511,when we struck the boat she was about done loading and pretty soon she got off
test0512,now hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the new carpet bags
test0513,so then they waited for a steam boat
test0514,that the king was calm he says
test0515,they give a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to say would you tell you
test0516,then one of them says kinda soft and gentle
test0517,felps was one of these little one horse cotton plantations and they all look alike
test0518,i went in around and climb over the back style by the ash hopper and started for the kitchen
test0519,i out with a yes or a no i thought
test0520,so then she started for the house leading me by the hand and the children tugging after
test0521,when we got there she set me down in a split bottom chair and set herself down on a little stool in front of me holding both of my hands
test0522,well it's lucky because sometimes people do get hurt
test0523,and i think he died afterwards he was a baptist
test0524,yes it was mortification that was it
test0525,your uncle's been up to the town every day to fetch you
test0526,you must have met him on the road didn't you older man with a
test0527,why child it'll be stolen
test0528,it was kinder thin eyes but i says
test0529,i had my mind on the children all the time i wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little and find out who i was
test0530,pretty soon she made the cold chill streak all down my back because she says
test0531,i see it weren't a bit of try to go ahead i'd got to throw up my hand
test0532,so i says to myself here's another place where i got to rest the truth
test0533,i opened my mouth to begin but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed and says here it comes
test0534,children don't say you a word
test0535,i see i was in a fix now
test0536,missus felps she jumps for him and says
test0537,has he come no says her husband
test0538,i can't imagine says the old gentleman and i must say it makes me dreadfully uneasy
test0539,un easy she says i'm ready to go distracted
test0540,he must have come and you've missed him along the road
test0541,oh don't distress me anymore and i'm already distressed
test0542,why silas look yonder up the road eh ain't somebody comin
test0543,the old gentleman stared and says
test0544,i ain't no idea who is
test0545,it's tom soyer
test0546,being tom soyer was easy and comfortable and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by i hear a steamboat coughing along down the river
test0547,then i says to myself suppose tim soar comes down on that boat
test0548,but i am hugely pleased that you have seen my lady
test0549,i knew you could not choose but like her yet but let me tell you you have seen but the worst of her
test0550,her conversation has more charms and can be in mere beauty and a humor and disposition would make a deformed person appear lovely
test0551,why did you not send me that news and a gallan
test0552,well the best on it is that i have a squaire now that is as good as a knight
test0553,in earnest we have had such a skirmish and upon so foolish an occasion as i cannot tell which strangers are
test0554,all the people that i had ever in my life refused were brought again upon the stage like richard the third's ghosts to reproach me with wh
test0555,my best qualities if i have any that are good served but for aggravations of my fault and i was allowed to have wit and understanding and discretion in
test0556,it's strange change and i'm very sorry for it but i'll swear i know not how to help it
test0557,mister fish is a squaw of dames and has so many mistresses that anybody may pretend to share in him and be believed though i have
test0558,i think my younger brother comes down with him
test0559,i can no sooner give you some little hints whereabout they live but you know them presently and i meant you should be beholding to me for your
test0560,but it seems this gentleman is not so easy access but may you acknowledge something due to me if i incline him to look graciously upon you and
test0561,i have missed four fits and i have but had five and have recovered so much strength as made me venture to meet your letter on wednesday a mile
test0562,but besides i can give you others
test0563,i am here much more out of people's way than in town where my aunt and such as pretend and interest in me and a power over me do
test0564,you will think him altered and if it would be possible more melancholy than he was
test0565,if marriage agrees no better with other people than it does with him i shall pray that all my friends may seize it
test0566,well in earnest if i were a prince that lady should be my mistress but i can give no rule to anyone else and perhaps those that are in no
test0567,the matter is not great for i confess i do naturally hate the noise and talk of the world and should be best pleased never to be known in it
test0568,if i had a picture that will fit for you you should have it
test0569,how can you talk of defying fortune nobody lives without it and therefore why should you imagine you could
test0570,i know not how my brother comes to be so well informed as you say but i am certain he knows ye utmost of the injuries you have received from
test0571,we have had another debate but much more calmly
test0572,and besides there was a time when we ourselves were indifferent to one another did i do so then or have i learned it since
test0573,i have been studying how tom cheek might come by his intelligence and i very believe he has it from my cousin peters
test0574,how kindly do i take your disabilities of your fathers in earnest you cannot imagine how his letter pleases me
test0575,would it leave me and then i could believe i shall not always have occasion for it
test0576,my poor lady vavasar is carried to the tower and her great belly could not excuse her because she was acquainted by somebody that there was a plot
test0577,she has told now all that was told her but vows she will never say from whence she had it we shall see whether her resolutions are as unalter
test0578,i wonder how she behaved herself when she was married
test0579,i never saw any one yet that did not look simply and out of countenance no never knew a wedding well designed but one and that was of two
test0580,the truth is i could not endure to be a missus bride in a public wedding to be made the happiest person on earth
test0581,do not take it ill for i would endure it if i could rather than fail but in earnest i do not think it were possible for me
test0582,yet in earnest your father will not find my brother pateon wanting in civility though he is not a man of much compliment lest it be in
test0583,my aunt told me no longer gone than yesterday that i was the most wilful woman that ever she knew and had an obstinacy of spirit nothing
test0584,you see i give you fair warning
test0585,by the next i shall be gone into kent and my other journeys laid aside which i am displeased at because it would have broken our intercourse very much
test0586,here are some verses of carlyle tell me how you like them
test0587,i told you in my last that my affable journey was laid aside and that into kenthurst
test0588,if i drown by the way this will be my last letter and like a will i bequeath all my kindness to you in it with a charge
test0589,indeed i like him extremely and he is commended to me by people that know him very well and are able to judge for a most excellent servant and
test0590,because you find fault with my other letters this is like to be shorter than they i did not intend so though i can show you
test0591,i do not find it though i am told i was so extremely when i believed you love me
test0592,but i am called upon
test0593,directed for your master
test0594,i see you chink when you please and with authority but i deserve it i confess and all i can say for myself is that my fault proceeded from
test0595,we dare not let our tongues lie more on one side of our masks than the other for fear of overturning it
test0596,you are satisfied i hope if that is what i escape drowning
test0597,but i am troubled much you should make so ill a journey to so little purpose indeed i read by the first post after my arrival here and cannot imagine
test0598,how welcome you will be but alas
test0599,for my life i cannot beat into their heads a passion that must be subject to no decay an even perfect kindness that must last perpetually without the least
test0600,they laughed to hear me say that one unkind word would destroy all the satisfaction of my life and that i should expect our kindness should increase every day
test0601,we go abroad all day and play all night and say our prayers when we have time
test0602,well in sober earnestness now i would not live as twelve months to gain all that the king has lost unless it were to give him another
test0603,will you be so good natured?
test0604,he has one son and it is the finest boy that ever you saw and has a noble spirit but yet stands in that awe of his father that one
test0605,you must give me leave to entertain you with discourse of the family for i can tell you nothing else from hence
test0606,not to know when you would come home i can assure you nor for any other occasion of my own but with a cousin of mine that had long designed
test0607,in my life i never heard so ridiculous a discourse as he made us and no old woman who passes for a witch could have been more puzzled to seek
test0608,ever since this adventure i have had so great a belief in all things with this nature that i could not forbear laying a pease cod with nine
test0609,she pulled her hair down turned her skirt back put her feet on the fender and took patty to her lap of all which arrangements signify that something
test0610,the more proposals the more credit
test0611,i've tried it and liked it and maybe this is the consequence of that night's fun
test0612,just suppose it is true that he does ask me and i say yes
test0613,what a spiteful thing i am!
test0614,i could do so much for all at home how i should enjoy that
test0615,let me see how can i begin
test0616,he has known her all her life and has a good influence over her
test0617,now as polly was by no means a perfect creature i am free to confess that the old temptation assailed her more than once that week for when
test0618,i don't think it was his wealth accomplishments or position that most attracted polly though these doubtless possess the greater influence than she suspected
test0619,it was that indescribable something which women are quick to see and feel in men who have been blessed with wise and good mothers
test0620,this had an especial charm to polly for she soon found that this side of her character was not shown to every one
test0621,lateley this had changed especially towards polly and it flattered her more than she would confess even to herself
test0622,at first she tried to think she could but unfortunately hearts are so contrary that they won't be befitting to reason will or even credence
test0623,pally felt a very cordial friendship for mister sydney but not one particle of the love which has the only coin in which love can be
test0624,this finished polly's indecision and after that night she never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant temptation which came in a guy particularly attractive to a
test0625,when saturday came polly started as usual for a visit to becky and west but couldn't resist stopping at the shores to leave a little parcel
test0626,a foolish little speech to make to a dark but you see polly was only a tender hearted girl trying to do her duty
test0627,take hold of master charlie's hair miss mimi and wrap pretty like willie flossy said the maid
test0628,at a street corner a black eyed school boy was parting from a rosie faced school girl whose music role he was reluctantly surrendering
test0629,how he got there was never very clear to polli but there he was flushed and a little out of breath but looking so glad to see her till
test0630,she really couldn't help it it was so pleasant to see him again just when she was feeling so lonely
test0631,that is the way i get to the rass answered polly
test0632,she did not mean to tell but his frankness was so agreeable she forgot herself
test0633,but i know her better and i assure you that she does improve she tries to mean her thoughts though she won't own it and will surprise you some
test0634,"thank you, no"
test0635,how lovely the park looks she said in great confusion
test0636,"ask the art for young men, laying a trap into which polly immediately fell."
test0637,he was quicker to take a hint than she had expected and being both proud and generous wished off to settle the matter at once for polly's sake
test0638,so when she made her last brilliant remark he said quietly watching her face keenly all the while i thought so well i'm going out of town on
test0639,she thought she had a good deal of the coquettish in her and i have no doubt that with time and draining she would have become a
test0640,he was gone before she could do anything but look up at him with a remorseful face and she walked on feeling that the first and perhaps the only
test0641,pally did not return to her favourite walk till she learned for minnie that uncle had really left town and then she found that his friendly company and
test0642,working two and four as usual what's the news with you
test0643,perhaps shielded him
test0644,utterly done with and laid upon the shelf
test0645,minnie said the other day she wished she was a pigeon so she could paddle in the ponds and not fuss about rabbits
test0646,now don't be affected polly but just tell me like a deer hasn't he proposed
test0647,don't you think he means to?
test0648,truly july fan
test0649,"i don't mean to be praying, but i really thought he did."
test0650,well i always meant to try if i got a chance and i have
test0651,i just gave him a hint and he took it
test0652,he meant to go away before that so then don't think his heart is broken or mind what tiddy tellers say
test0653,he understood and being a gentleman made no fuss
test0654,but polly it would have been a grand thing for you
test0655,i'm odd you know i prefer to be an independent spinster and teach music all my days
test0656,never mind what the business was it serves as to say that it was a good beginning for a young man like tom who have been born and bred in
test0657,fortunately every one was so busy with the necessary preparations that there was no time for romances of any sort and the four young people worked together as sober
test0658,pity that the end shall come so soon but the hour did its work and went its way leaving a clearer atmosphere behind but the young folks did not
test0659,if it had not been for two things i fear she never would have stood a summer in town but sydney often called to her vacation came and the
test0660,tam wrote once a week to his mother the letters were short and not very satisfactory for men never do tell the interesting little things that women best like to
test0661,now i am only tired had a good deal to do lately and the dull weather makes me just a travel bro
test0662,"forgive me, but i can't help saying it for it is there and i want to be as true to you as you were to me if"
test0663,i try not to deceive myself but it seems as if there was a chance of happiness for me
test0664,thank heaven for that!
test0665,goadly with the hardest satisfaction in her voice.
test0666,"poor polly was so taken by surprise that she had no word to say,"
test0667,none when needed she told her face answered for her as well as the impulse which made her hide her head in the sofa cushion like a foolish ostrich
test0668,"once or twice but sort of chuckling and i thought it was only some little flotation,"
test0669,it was so stupid of me not to guess before.
test0670,it was so tender earnest and defiant that fenny forgot the defense of her own lover in admiration of polly's loyalty to hers for this faithful
test0671,"i hope maria blythe is only thinking her. she shared softly, for i could not bear to have him disappointed again."
test0672,said fenny turning hopeful all at once.
test0673,"suppose i say a word to ton, just askin' after his heart, and give him a chance to tell me if there's anything to"
test0674,"bear it people always do bear things somehow and said polly, looking as if sentence had been passed upon her."
test0675,it was a very different window from the last for both the girls.
test0676,if any wanted to show her what she could do toward making a pleasant home she certainly succeeded by than she suspected for in spite of many failures and discour
test0677,"she kept much at home when the day's work was done, finding it pleasant to sit dreaming of a book or sooner alone than to exert herself even"
test0678,polly was not at all like herself that windmill and those nearest to her saw and wondered at most
test0679,for net was so absorbed in business that he ignored the whole baley question and left them in other darkness.
test0680,"then he came walking in upon her one day, looking as if she poured out her heart of such great joy that she hardly knew how to tell them"
test0681,but if work baskets were gifted with powers of speech they could tell stories more true and tender than any we read.
test0682,she had even been in society before the revolution
test0683,it was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names on every preface
test0684,every year she solemnly renewed her vows and at the moment of taking the oath she said to the priest monsieur saint francis gave it to
test0685,and the schoolgirls would begin to laugh not in their sleeves but under their veils charming little trifled laughs which made the vocal mothers frown
test0686,it was a century which spoke through her but it was the eighteenth century
test0687,the rule of van troute did not forbid this
test0688,she would not show this object to anyone
test0689,thus it furnished a subject of comment for all who were on occupied or boarded in the convent
test0690,some unique chaplet some authentic relic
test0691,they lost themselves in conjectures
test0692,when the poor old woman died they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting perhaps and opened it
test0693,he is resisting fluttering his tiny wings and still making an effort to fly but the dancers are laughing with a satanic air
test0694,moral love conquered by the collyer
test0695,the praetor returned and seated herself once more on her chair
test0696,we will present a stencilographic report of the dialogue which then ensued to the best of our ability
test0697,father forvent
test0698,reverend mother do you know the chapel
test0699,and you have been in the choir and pursuance of your duties two or three times
test0700,there is a stone to be raised heavy
test0701,the slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar
test0702,the slab which closes the vault yes
test0703,it would be a good thing to have two men for it
test0704,a woman is never a man
test0705,because dom marbilla gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of saint bernard while marlonus horseman only gives three hundred and sixty seven i
test0706,marriage consists in working according to one's strength a cloister is not a dock yard
test0707,"and a woman is not a man but my brother is the strongest, though"
test0708,and can you get a girl?
test0709,there is a ring in the stone
test0710,i will put the lever through it
test0711,that is good reverend mother i will open the vault
test0712,will that be all no
test0713,give me your orders very reverend mother
test0714,for that we have confidence in you
test0715,i am here to do anything you wish
test0716,and to hold your peace about everything yes reverend mother
test0717,where the vaults are open i will close it again
test0718,but before that what reverend mother
test0719,father for venus reverend mother
test0720,you know that my mother died this morning
test0721,no did you not hear the bell
test0722,nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden really
test0723,and then the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning
test0724,it was mother's crucifixion
test0725,three years ago madame de pithou a jansenist turned orthodox merely for having seen mother crucifixion at prayer ah
test0726,the mothers have taken her to the dormitory which opens on the church i know
test0727,a fine sight it would be to see an entrance at the door more often
test0728,hey more often
test0729,what do you say
test0730,i say more often more often than what
test0731,reverend mother i did not say more often than watch i said more often
test0732,but i did not say it more often
test0733,at that moment nine o'clock struck
test0734,at nine o'clock in the morning and at all hours praised and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar said the priest
test0735,it cut more often short
test0736,flavien mopped his forehead
test0737,in her lifetime mother crucifixion made converts after her death she will perform miracles she will
test0738,fatherly virtue the community has been blessed in mother's crucifixion
test0739,she retained her consciousness to the very last moment
test0740,she gave her last commands
test0741,if you had a little more faith and if you could have been in her cell she would have cured you merely by touching it she smiled
test0742,there was something of paradise in that death
test0743,flavio lattau thought that it was an aurora which she was finishing
test0744,forlornault held his piece she went on
test0745,i have consulted upon this point many ecclastics labouring in our lord who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life and bear wonderful fruit
test0746,fortunately the prius completely absorbed in her own thoughts did not hear it.
test0747,she continued further prevent
test0748,yes reverend mother
test0749,sternchen bishop of port where the mouth of the tiber empties into the sea requested that on that his tomb might be engraved the sign which
test0750,the dead must be obeyed so be it
test0751,for that matter no reverence
test0752,suffer before mother crucifixion will be interred in the coffin in which she has slept for the last twenty years that is just
test0753,it is a continuation of her slumber
test0754,so i shall have to nail up that coffin yes
test0755,i am at the orders of the very reverend community
test0756,the four mother presences will assist you
test0757,no in lowering the coffin
test0758,where into the vault
test0759,florence vaulted started the vault under the altar
test0760,under the altar but
test0761,you will have an iron bar yes but
test0762,you will raise the stone with bar by means of the ring but
test0763,the dead must be obeyed to be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel not to go to profane earth to remain there when death
test0764,she asked of us that is to say commanded us
test0765,but it is forbidden
test0766,oh i am a stone in your vaults
test0767,think father voren if she were to work miracles here
test0768,what glory of god for the community and miracles issue from tombs
test0769,but reverend mother is the agent of the sanitary commission
test0770,but the commission of police
test0771,shonodamar one of the seven german kings who entered among the galls under the empire of constance precisely recognized the right of nuns to
test0772,the world is nothing in the presence of the cross
test0773,martin the eleventh general of the carthaginians gave to his order this device staurus domus volutarius orbis
test0774,the piraeus who is usually subject to the barrier of silence and whose reservoir was over full rose and exclaimed with the loquacity of a dam
test0775,i have on my right bernard and on my left bernard who was bernard
test0776,the first abbot of claverie
test0777,his order has produced forty popes hundred cardinals fifty patriarchs sixteen hundred arch bishops four thousand six hundred bishops four emperors twelve emperors
test0778,on one side saint bernard on the other the agent of the senatorial department
test0779,god subordinated to the commission of police such as the age silence forvo
test0780,no one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulchre
test0781,only fanatics and those in error deny it.
test0782,we live in times of terrible confusion
test0783,we are ignorant and impertinent
test0784,and then religion is attacked why
test0785,because there have been bad priests because sagittarius bishop of gapp was a brother of solon bishop of embrum and because both of them
test0786,they persecute the saints
test0787,they shut their eyes to the truth darkness is the rule
test0788,the most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind
test0789,oh how wicked people are
test0790,by order of the king signifies to day by order of the revolution
test0791,one no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead a holy death is prohibited
test0792,guthier bishop of chalon held his own in this matter against otho duke of burgundy
test0793,the priory took breath then turned to falardean
test0794,you will close the coffin the sisters will carry it to the chapel.
test0795,the office for the dead will then be set
test0796,but she will hear she will not listen
test0797,besides what the cloak knows the world learns not
test0798,a pause in suit
test0799,you will remove your bell.
test0800,has the doctor for the dead paid his visit
test0801,he will pay at four o'clock to day
test0802,the peel which orders the doctor for the death to be summoned has already been wrong.
test0803,but you do not understand any of the pies
test0804,"that is well, father prevent"
test0805,where will you obtain it
test0806,i have my heap of old iron at the bottom of the garden
test0807,reverend mother what
test0808,if you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort my brother is the strong man for you a perfect turk
test0809,you will do it as speedily as possible
test0810,i cannot work very fast i'm infirm that is why i require an assistant i limp
test0811,everything must have been completed a good quarter of an hour before that
test0812,i will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community these are my orders i am to nail up the coffin
test0813,at eleven o'clock exactly i am to be in the chapel.
test0814,mother succession will be there two men would be better
test0815,"however, never mind i shall have my lover"
test0816,after which there will be no trace of anything
test0817,the government will have no suspicion
test0818,the empty coffins remain this produced a pause
test0819,what is to be done with that coffin father what is to be done with that coffin father
test0820,it will be given to the earth empty
test0821,ah ladie exclaimed foolishly
test0822,the veil stuck fast in his throat
test0823,he made haste to improvise and expeditiously to make her forget the oath
test0824,i will put earth in the coffin reverend mother that will produce the effect of a corpse
test0825,i will make that my special business
test0826,"general observations on preserves, confectionery, ice and dessert dishes"
test0827,the expense of preserving them with sugar is a serious objection for except a sugar is used in considerable quantities the success is very uncertain
test0828,fruit gathered in wet or foggy weather will soon be milled and be of no service for preserves
test0829,but to distinguish these properly requires very great attention and considerable experience
test0830,if you dip the finger into the serum and apply to the thumb the tenacity of the serum will on separating the finger and thumb afford a thread which
test0831,let it boil up again and then take it off and remove carefully the scum that has risen
test0832,it is considered to be sufficiently boiled when some take up a spoon pours out like oil
test0833,before sugar was in use honey was employed to preserve many vegetable productions though this substance is now given to give the juice of the sugar cane
test0834,fourteen ninety nine
test0835,boil them up three days sufficiently skimming each time and they will then be finished and in a state fit to be put on pots for use
test0836,the reason why the fruit is emptied out of the preserving pan into an urn pan is that the acid of the fruit acts upon the preserving pans are usually
test0837,from this example the process of preserving fruits with syrup would be easily comprehended
test0838,they should be dried in the stove or on a sieve and turned every six or eight hours fresh powdered sugar should be sifted over them every time they
test0839,and in this way it is also that orange and lemon slices are preserved
test0840,marmalades jams and fruit preserves are of the same nature and are now in very general quest
test0841,marmalades and jams differ little from each other their preserves of half liquid consistency made by boiling the pulp of fruits and sometimes part of the r
test0842,that they may keep it is necessary not to be sparing of sugar fifteen o three
test0843,in all the operations for preserving making when the preserving pan is used it should not be placed on the fire but on a trivet unless the jam is
test0844,confectionery fifteen o eight
test0845,in speaking of confectionery should be remarked that all the various preparations above named come strictly speaking under that head from the various fruits flowers herbs and roots
test0846,the thousand and one ornamented dishes that adorn the tables of the wealthy should be purchased from the confectioner and they cannot profitably be made at
test0847,however as late as the reign of our two last georgians fabulous sums were often expended upon fanciful desserts
test0848,the shape of the dishes varies at different periods the prevailing fashion at present being oval and circular dishes on stems
test0849,ayes
test0850,at desserts or at some evening parties ice cream is scarcely to be dispensed with
test0851,the splat is generally made of copper kept bright and clean
test0852,they should be taken immediately after the repast or some hours after because the taking of these substances during the process of digestion is apt to provoke indigest
test0853,there was once a time a widow who had a son and a daughter by his first wife
test0854,from the very day that the new wife came into the house there was no peace for the men's children and not a corner to be found where they
test0855,but his sister who was still at home fared worse and worse
test0856,kiss me girl said the head
test0857,when the king entered and saw he stood still as if he were fetters and could not stir from the spot for the picture seen to him so beautiful
test0858,the youth promised to make all the haste he could and set forth from the king's palace
test0859,at last they came inside of land
test0860,well if my brother says so i must do said the man's daughter and she flung her cloak into the sea
test0861,what is my brother saying asked his sister again
test0862,on the first thursday night after this a beautiful maiden came into the kitchen of the palace and begged the kitchen maid who slept there to lend her a
test0863,she begged very pritily and got it and then she brushed her hair and the gold dropped from it
test0864,out on the ugly bushy bride sleeping so soft on the young king's side on sand and stones my bed i make and my brother sleeps with a
test0865,i shall come twice more and then never again said she
test0866,this time also as before she borrowed a brush and brushed her hair with it and the gold dropped down as she did it and again she sent the dog
test0867,no one can tell how delighted the king got to get rid of that hideous bushy bride and get a queen who was bright and beautiful as her
test0868,wilt doubt serve me and watch my seven fowls as the king
test0869,the youth thought that it was very easy work to wash the fols and that he could do it well enough
test0870,has watched faithfully and well the whole day long said the king when the lad came into his presence in the evening
test0871,yes that i have said the youth
test0872,he had gone out at once to seek a place he said but never would he do such a thing again
test0873,then the king promised him the same punishment and the same reward but he had promised his brother
test0874,when he had run after the fools for a long long time and was hot and tired he passed by a cliffe in the rock where an old woman
test0875,come hither come hither my handsome son and let me comb your hair
test0876,the youth liked the thought of this let the fools run where they chose and seated themselves in the clout of the rock by the side of the old
test0877,so there he sat with his head on her lap taking his ease the livelong day
test0878,on the third day sylvia wanted to set out
test0879,the two brothers laughed at him and his father and mother begged him not to go but all to no purpose and synder lad set out on his way
test0880,i am walking about in search of a place at cinderella
test0881,i would much rather have the princess at cinderella
test0882,"and lest they journey onward, a long, long way"
test0883,when they had gone us for a long long way the fool again asked dost thou see anything now
test0884,yes now i see something that is white said indy
test0885,it looks like a chunk of a great thick birch tree
test0886,cinderella had tried but could not do it so he had to take a draw from the pitcher and then one more and after that still another and
test0887,for we are brothers of the princess whom thou art to have when thou canst tell the king what we eat and drink but there is a mighty troll
test0888,when they had travelled a long long way the fool said doesst thou see anything
test0889,"and now inquireful, see that nothin' now?"
test0890,now then said the fore didst not see any thing now
test0891,that is a river said the full and we have to cross it
test0892,i have done my repaid sir laddie
test0893,once upon a time there was a king in the north who had won many wars but now he was old
test0894,the old king went out and fought bravely but at last his sword broke and he was wounded and his men fled
test0895,but in the night when the battle was over his young wife came out and searched for him among the slain and at last she found him and asked whether
test0896,so yes the queen how do you know in the dark of night whether the hours are wearing to the morning and she said
test0897,then the old man said drive all the horses into the river and choose the one that swims across
test0898,he is no bigger than other dragons said the tutor and if you were as brave as your father you would not fear him
test0899,then the person who had killed otter went down and caught the dove who owned all the treasure and took it from him
test0900,only one ring was left which the dwarf wore and even that was taken from him
test0901,so rigo made a sword and sigar tried it with a blow on a lump of iron and the sword broke
test0902,then sigrid went to his mother and asked for the broken pieces of his father's blade and gave them to regen
test0903,so segor said that sword would do
test0904,then he saw the track which the dragon had made when he went to a cliff to drink and the track was as if a great river had rolled along
test0905,but sigurd waited till half of him had crawled over the pit and then he thrust the sword gram right into his very heart
test0906,sigrid said i would touch none of it if by losing it i should never die
test0907,but all men die and no brave man lets death frighten him from his desire
test0908,dye av fahner and then av fahner died
test0909,then sigrid rode back and met george and george asked him to roast faverne's heart and let him taste of it
test0910,so sir put the heart of fava on a steak and roasted it
test0911,there's sigrid roasting faverne's heart for another when he should taste of it himself and learn all wisdom
test0912,"that let him do, then ride over hyndford to the place where brinhill's sleeps."
test0913,there must she sleep till ye comes for her waking rise up and ride for now sure she will swear the vow fearful of breaking
test0914,then he took the helmet off the head of the sleeper and behold she was the most beautiful lady
test0915,then sigurd rode away and he came to the house of a king who had a fair daughter
test0916,lin burland's father told gunner that she would marry none but him who could ride the flame in front of her enchanted tower and the d
test0917,for one day when burnham and gunderson were bathing burnham waited farthest out into the river and said she did that to show she was
test0918,for her husband she said she had ridden through the flame when no other man dared face it
test0919,not long to wait he said till the bitter sword stands fast in my heart and now will not live long when i am dead
test0920,lobsters and lobsters
test0921,when is a lobster not a lobster when it is a crayfish
test0922,this question and answer might well go into the primary of information for those who come to san francisco from the east for what is called a lobster in
test0923,the pacific crocodile however serves every purpose and while many contend that its meat is not so delicately flavored as that of its eastern cousin the california
test0924,a book would be written about this restaurant and then all would not be told for all its secrets can never be known
test0925,it was here that most magnificent dinners were arranged it was here that extraordinary dishes were concocted by chefs with worldwide fame it was here that lobster el

test0930,king of shellfish
test0931,one has to come to san francisco to partake of the king of shellfish the mammoth pacific crab
test0932,i say come to san francisco advisably for while the crab is found all along the coast it is prepared no so much deliciousness as in san
test0933,gobies passed with the fire and the little restaurant bearing his name in charge of his widow in union square avenue has not attained the fame of the

test0939,heep this in a stew pan and when simmering add the sherry and crab meat and let all cook together with the slow fire for eight minutes
test0940,serve in a chafing dish with toasted crackers or thin slices of toasted bread
test0941,lobster in miniature
test0942,so far it has been used mostly for garlanding of other dishes and it is only recently that the wolf's brow has been making a specialty of them
test0943,all of the better class restaurants however will serve them if you order them
test0944,this is the recipe for eight people and it is well worth trying if you are giving a dinner of importance
test0945,biscuit of craphsh
test0946,take thirty croft fish from which removed the gut containing the gall in the following manner take firm hold of the croft fish with the left hand so

test0961,if they did not let themselves be seen they let themselves be felt said sancho if not let my shoulder speak to the point
test0962,mine could speak too said donkey hoodie but that is not a suspicious reason for believing what that we see is the enchanted moor
test0963,the officer turned in room and said well how's it goes a good man
test0964,sandra got up with enough in his bones and went after the innkeeper in the dark in meeting the officer who was looking to see what had become
test0965,to be brief he took the materials of which he made a compound mixing them all and boiling them a good while that until it seemed to him they had
test0966,sandra ponsa who also regarded the amendment of his master as miraculous begged him to give him what was left was no small quantity

test0970,then this is an inn sent to danny howie
test0971,and a very respectable one said the innkeeper
test0972,the cries of the plundered wretch were so loud that they reached the ears of his master who halting to listen attentively was persuaded that some
test0973,he saw him rising and falling in the air with such grace and nimbleness that had his rage at him it is my belief he would have left

test0990,that the nun who had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed and interred in the vault under
test0991,that the priest and the vocal mothers intended to fulfill wish of the deceased
test0992,that he furlonge was to nail up the coffin in the cell raised the stone in the chapel and blow the corpse into the vault
test0993,and then that there was another the empty coffin
test0994,what is that empty coffin
test0995,ask john van john florence replied
test0996,what coffin what administration

test0999,and i add and father madeline is buried ar
test1000,you are not like other men father mather
test1001,this offers the means give me some information in the first place
test1002,how long is the coffin six feet
test1003,it is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening on the garden which is closed on the outside by a shutter and two doors one
test1004,the church in the street the church which anyone can enter
test1005,have you the keys to those two doors
test1006,no i have the key to the door which communicates with the convent the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church
test1007,only to allow the undertakers to men when they come to get the coffin
test1008,who nails up the coffin i do
test1009,she spreads the plough over it
test1010,not another man except the police doctor can enter the dungeon that is even written on the wall
test1011,could you hide me in that room tonight when everyone is asleep
test1012,about three o'clock in the afternoon
test1013,i shall be hungry but i will bring you something
test1014,you can come and nail me up in the coffin at two o'clock
test1015,flushville coiled and cracked his finger joints but that is impossible
test1016,but impossible to take a hammer and drive some nails in a plank
test1017,jean valjean had been in worse straighter than this
test1018,any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape
test1019,what does not a man undertake for the sake of a cure
test1020,to have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bale of goods to live for a long time in a box to find air where
test1021,you surely must have a gimlet you will make a few holes here and there around my mouth and you will nail the top plank loosely good and what
test1022,a man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze
test1023,who is there who has not said to a cat do come in
test1024,the overprovident cats as they are and because they are cats sometimes incure more danger than the audacious
test1025,but jean valjean's coolness prevailed over him in spite of himself he grumbled
test1026,if you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right i am sure of getting you out of the grave
test1027,an old fellow of the old school the grave digger puts the corpses in the grave and i put the grave digger in my pocket
test1028,i shall follow. that is my business.

test1032,that is settled father fushu leonard all will go well
test1033,on the following day as the sun was declining the very rare passes by on the boulevard du men pulled off their hats to an old fashioned huss
test1034,this hirst contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross like a huge corpse with drooping arms
test1035,a morning coach in which could be seen a priest in his surplus and a choir boy in his red cap followed
test1036,behind it came an old man in the garments of a labourer who limped along
test1037,the grave diggers being thus bound to serve in the evening in summer and at night in winter in this cemetery they were subject to a special discipline
test1038,these gates therefore swung inequitably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the invincible
test1039,dampness was invading it the flowers were desiring it
test1040,the bourgeoise did not care much about being buried in the vaucluse it hinted at poverty palechasse if you please

test1043,it is one of the faults which resemble a duty
test1044,the nuns had committed it not only without difficulty even with the applause of their own consciences
test1045,in the cloister what is called the government is only an intermeddling with authority and interference which is always questionable
test1046,make as many laws as you please men but keep them for yourselves
test1047,a prince is nothing in the presence of a principal
test1048,vulcanon limped along behind the hercules in a very contented frame of mind
test1049,jean valjean's composition was one of those powerful tranquillities which are contagious
test1050,what remain'd to be done was a mere nothing
test1051,he played with father mitchell.
test1052,he did what he liked with him he made dance according to his whim
test1053,the permission for internment must be exhibited
test1054,he was a sort of labouring man who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a mattock under his arm
test1055,the man replied the grave digger
test1056,the grave digger yes
test1057,you aye
test1058,far miss tiffany is the grave digger he was
test1059,foucault leonard had expected anything but this that a grave digger could die
test1060,it is true nevertheless that grave diggers do die themselves
test1061,he had hardly the strength to stammer
test1062,but he persisted feebly father misty is the grave digger
test1063,do you know little father laurence is he a jug of red wine?
test1064,but you are a jolly fellow too
test1065,are you not comrade we'll go and have a drink together presently
test1066,the man replied
test1067,he limped more out of anxiety than from infirmity
test1068,the grave digger walked on in front of him
test1069,fouchville passed the unexceptionable clavier once more in review fouchville passed the unexceptionable clavier once more in review
test1070,fleurville who was illiterate but very sharp understood that he had to deal with a formidable species of man with a fine talker he muttered
test1071,but so father mason is dead

test1076,furiously of thought i am lost
test1077,there were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small alley leading to the nun's corner
test1078,and he added with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well
test1079,fortunately the soil which was light and wet with the winter rains clod the wheels and retired its speed
test1080,my father was a porter at the pritienium town hall
test1081,but he had reverses he had losses on change i was obliged to renounce the profession of author but i am still a public writer
test1082,so you are not a grave digger then
test1083,returned volvo clucking at this branch feeble as it was
test1084,here a remark becomes necessary
test1085,a floraison de whatever his anguish offered a drink but he did not explain himself on one point who was to pay
test1086,the grave digger went on with a superior smile
test1087,one must eat
test1088,the duke comes every morning they will tell him when he comes that i am asleep and perhaps he will wait until i awake
test1089,yes but if i should already ask for something what

test1096,the more girl believes in goodness the more isley will give way if not to her lover at least to love for being without mistrust she is without
test1097,then how surely must they desire the world which is hidden from them how surely must they find it tempting how surely must they listen to the first voice which
test1098,with them the body has worn out the soul the senses have burned up the heart dissipation has blunted the feelings
test1099,"they love by profession, and not by instinct."
test1100,when a creature who has all her past to reproach herself with is taken all at once by a profound sincere irreproachable love of which she had
test1101,they know not what proof to give
test1102,in order to disturb the laborers in the field was one day devoured by a wolf because those whom he had so often deceived no longer believed in
test1103,this is the same with these unhappy women when they love sincerely
test1104,but when the man who inspires this redeeming love is great enough in soul to receive it without remembering the past when he gives himself up to it when
test1105,but to return to the first day of my liaison
test1106,"when i reached home, i was in a state of mad gaiety."
test1107,the woman becomes the man's mistress and loves him.
test1108,how why?
test1109,my whole being was exalted into joy at the memory of the words we had exchanged during that first night
test1110,here are my orders tonight avodio
test1111,call during the third and trant
test1112,"the boxes filled one after another,"
test1113,"only one remains empty, the stage box."
test1114,at the beginning of the third act i heard the door of the box on which my eyes had been almost constantly fixed open and marguerite appeared
test1115,did she love me enough to believe that the more beautiful she looked the happier i should be?
test1116,what is the matter with you to night said marguerite rising and coming to the back of the box and kissing me on the forehead
test1117,you should go to bed she replied with that ironic era which went so well with her delicate and witty face
test1118,where at home
test1119,you still love me can you ask
test1120,because you don't like seeing him
test1121,notwithstanding i was very unhappy all the rest of the evening and went away very sadly after having seen prudence the count and marigold get into
test1122,i have not come to hinder you from leaving paris.
test1123,"you in the way marigrette, but how?"
test1124,"well, you might have had a woman here, said prudence and it would hardly have been amusing for her to see two more arrive."
test1125,during this remark marquise looked at me attentively
test1126,my dear prudence i answered he do not know what you are saying
test1127,yes but besides not wishing to put you out i was sure that if you came as far as my door you would want to come up and as i
test1128,because i am watched and the least suspicion might do me the greatest harm
test1129,is that really the only reason
test1130,if there were any other i would tell you for we are not to have any secrets from one another now
test1131,honestly do you care for me a little a great deal
test1132,i fancied for a moment that i might give myself that happiness for six months you will not have it you insisted on knowing the means
test1133,well good heavens the means were easy enough to guess
test1134,i listened and i gazed marigold with admiration
test1135,when i thought that this marvelous creature whose feet i had once longed to kiss was willing to let me take my place in her thoughts my part in
test1136,truly she continued we poor creatures of chance have fantastic desire and inconceivable loves
test1137,we are not allowed to have hearts under the penalty of being hoisted down and of ruining our credit.
test1138,"we no longer belong to ourselves,"
test1139,"we stand first in their self-love, last in their self-esteem."
test1140,never do they give you advice which is not lucrative
test1141,it means little enough to them that we should have ten lovers extra as long as they get dresses or a bracelet out of them and that they can drive
test1142,such a man i found in the duke but the duke is old and the old age neither protects nor consoles
test1143,i thought i could accept the life which he offered me but what would you have?
test1144,what i loved in you was not the man who was but the man who was going to be
test1145,margarete tired out with this long confession threw herself back on the sofa and to siffle a slight cough put up her handkerchief to
test1146,marigrette do with me as you will i am your slave your dog but in the name of heaven tear up the letter which i wrote to you
test1147,marigold drew the letter from her bosom and handing it to me with a smile of infinite sweetness said
test1148,here it is i have brought it back
test1149,i tore the letter into fragments and kissed with tears the hand that gave it to me
test1150,look here prudens. do you know what he wants said margaret
test1151,he wants you to forgive him
test1152,one has to but he wants more than that what then?
test1153,i embraced margaret until she was almost stifled.

test1161,like most no count people he used to make a regular nuisance of himself poking his nose into everybody's business and never tending to his own
test1162,wasn't anything going on that this trifling member of the buzzard family didn't find out about a medal in he could ask more questions than

test1172,when he gets home he try and try to brush that suit off but it doesn't get into the skin and it stays there.

test1322,marius was clear eyed and he required the true light
test1323,the half lights of doubt painted him
test1324,whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was he could not halt there he was irresistibly constrained to continue to advance to examine to think to
test1325,he feared after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father to now take a step which should estrange him from that father
test1326,his discomfort was augmented by all the reflections which occurred to him
test1327,in the troubled state of his conscience he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence
test1328,they soon elbow him abruptly
test1329,request kofra to come and talk with me said maria
test1330,what is to become of you? said curraque.
test1331,what are you going to do i do not know
test1332,silver gold here it is
test1333,you will then have only a pair of trousers a west coat a hat and a coat and my boots
test1334,that will be enough
test1335,no it is not good what will you do after that?
test1336,do you know german no?
test1337,it is badly paid work but one can live by it
test1338,the clothes dealer was sent for
test1339,he paid twenty francs for the cast off garments they went to the watchmakers
test1340,he bought the watch for forty five francs
test1341,hello i'd forgotten that simon
test1342,the landlord presented his bill which had to be paid on the spot
test1343,"i have ten francs left, said marie."
test1344,that will be swallowing a tongue very fast or a hundred sue very slowly
test1345,one morning on his return from the school marie found a letter from his aunt and the sixty pistol that is to say six hundred francs and gold
test1346,marius sent back the thirteenth lukey to his aunt with the respectful letter in which he stated that he had sufficient means of subsistence and
test1347,at that moment he had three franks left
test1348,he perceived that it was no good talking to the old men and that the principal person in the house was the mother
test1349,before her he decided to scatter his pearls
test1350,the princess was distracted and did not know what to do she felt she had sinned against kitty
test1351,well doctor decide our fate said the princess tell me everything
test1352,is there hope she meant to say but her lips quivered and she could not utter out the question well doctor
test1353,as you please the princess went out with a sigh
test1354,the family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his observations
test1355,and there are indications malnutrition nervous excitability and so on
test1356,the question sends thus in presence of indications of tuberculosis process what is to be done to maintain nutrition
test1357,yes that's an understood thing responded to the celebrated physician again glancing it as the watch
test1358,beg pardon is the yosemite bridge done yet or shall i drive around
test1359,he asked ah it is
test1360,oh well then i can do it in twenty minutes
test1361,and how about a tour abroad asked the family doctor
test1362,what is wanted is the means of improving nutrition and not for lowering it
test1363,the family doctor listened attentively and respectfully
test1364,but in favor of foreign travel i would urge the change of habits the removal from conditions calling up remissions
test1365,and then the mother wishes it he said
test1366,ah well in that case to be sure let them go only those german quacks are mischievous
test1367,oh times are up already and he went to the door
test1368,the celebrated doctor announced to the princess a feeling of what was done from him dictated his doing so that he ought to see the patient once more
test1369,oh no oh only a few details princess come this way
test1370,and the mother accompanied by the doctor went into the drawing room to kitty
test1371,when the doctor came in she flushed crimson and her eyes filled with tears
test1372,she answered him and all at once got up furious
test1373,excuse me doctor but there is really no object in this
test1374,this is the third time you've asked me the same thing
test1375,the celebrated doctor did not take a fence
test1376,nervous irritability he said to the princess when kitty had left the room however i had finished
test1377,and the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess as an exceptionally intelligent woman the condition of the young princess and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters
test1378,at the question should they go abroad the doctor plunged into deep meditation as though resolving a weighty problem
test1379,finally his decision was pronounced they were to go abroad but to put no faith in foreign quacks and to apply him to him in any need
test1380,it seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the doctor had gone
test1381,the mother was much more cheerful when she went back to her daughter and kitty pretended to be more cheerful
test1382,educated people of the upper classes are trying to stifle the ever growing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social order
test1383,this is absolutely incorrect
test1384,in the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interest for the
test1385,the champions of the social conception of life usually try to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea of moral influence but this connection is
test1386,the man who is controlled by moral influence acts in accordance with his own desires
test1387,the basis of authority is bodily violence
test1388,the possibility of applying bodily violence to the people is provided above all by an organization of armed men trained to act in uniform and submission to one will
test1389,these bands of armed men submissive to a single will are what constitute the army
test1390,the army has always been and still is the basis of power
test1391,power is always in the hands of those who control the army and all men in power from the roman cesars to the russian and german emperors
test1392,indeed it could not be otherwise
test1393,only under those conditions could the social organization be justified
test1394,but since this is not the case and on the contrary men are power always far from being saints through the very fact of their possession of power the social
test1395,even if there was once a time when owing to the low standards of morals and the disposition of men to violence the existence of an authority to restrain such
test1396,between the members of one state subject to a single authority the strife between the individuals seemed still less and the life of the state seems even more secure
test1397,it was produced on one hand by the natural growth of the population and on the other by struggle and conquest
test1398,after conquest the power of the emperor puts in to internal dissensions and so the state conception of life justifies itself
test1399,but this justification is never more than temporary
test1400,internal dissensions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression exerted by the authority over the dissentient individuals
test1401,government authority even if it does suppress private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to
test1402,and therefore the oppression of the oppressed always goes on growing up to the fullest limit beyond which it cannot go without killing the goose with the golden egg
test1403,the most convincing example of this is to be found in the condition of the working classes of our app who are in reality no better than the slaves of
test1404,so it has always been
test1405,footnote the fact that in america the obusives of authority exist in spite of the small number of their troops not only fails to disprove this
test1406,the upper classes know that an army of fifty thousand will soon be insufficient and do longer relying on pincot's men they feel that the security of
test1407,the reason to which he gave expression is essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the pope engaged swiss and scotch guards and makes
test1408,the meaning of kippey's speech put in plain language is that funds are needed not to resist foreign foes but to buy under officers to be
test1409,and this abnormal order of things is maintained by the army
test1410,but there is not only one government there are other governments exploiting their subjects by violence in the same way and are always ready to pounce down on any
test1411,and so every government needs an army also to protect its booty from its brigands
test1412,this increases contagious as montague pointed out a hundred and fifty years ago
test1413,every increase in the army of one state with the aim of self defence against its subjects becomes a source of danger for neighbouring states and calls for a similar
test1414,the despotism of a government always increases with the strength of the army and its external successes and the aggressiveness of a government increases with its internal
test1415,the rivalry of the european states in constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse to universal military service since by that means the greatest
test1416,and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the inequities practised upon them all citizens have become their own impressors
test1417,this inconsistency has become obvious in universal military service
test1418,in fact the whole significance of the social conception of life consists in man's recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transitoriness of
test1419,but with universal military service it comes to pass that men after making every sacrifice to get rid of the cruelty of strife and the insecurity of existence are called
test1420,but instead of doing that they expose the individuals to the same necessity of strife substituting strife with individuals of other states for strife with neighbors
test1421,the taxes raised from the people for war preparations absorb the greater part of the produce of labour which the army ought to end
test1422,the danger of war ever ready to break out renders all reforms of life social life vain and fruitless
test1423,but the fatal significance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent in the social conception of life is not only appearing in that
test1424,governments assert that armies are needed above all for external defense but that is not true
test1425,they are needed principally against their subjects and every man under military territorial service becomes an accomplice and all the acts of violence of the government against the citizens
test1426,and for the sake of what am i making
test1427,i am expected for the sake of a state to make these sacrifices to renounce everything that can be precious to man peace family security and human dignity
test1428,except with the state they say we should be excluded to the attacks of evil disposed persons in our own country
test1429,we now know that threats and punishments cannot diminish their number that can only be done by change of environment and moral influence
test1430,so that the justification of state violence on the ground of the protection that gives us from evil disposed persons even if it had some foundation three or four centuries
test1431,except for the state they tell us we should not have any religion education culture means of communication and so
test1432,without the state men would not have been able to form the social institutions needed for doing anything
test1433,this argument too was well founded only some centuries ago
test1434,the great extension of means of communication and interchange of ideas has made men completely able to dispense with state aid in forming societies associations corporations and congresses
test1435,without governments nations would be enslaved by their neighbors
test1436,the government they tell us with its army is necessary to defend us from neighboring states that might slay us
test1437,and if defense against barbarian nations is meant one thousand part of the troops now under arms would be abundantly sufficient for that purpose
test1438,the power of the state far from being a security against the attacks of our neighbors exposes us as on the contrary to much greater danger of such attacks
test1439,even looking at it practically wang that is to say all the burdens laid on him by the state no man can fail to see that for him personally to
test1440,to resist would need independent thought and effort of which every man is not capable
test1441,so much for the advantages and disadvantages of both lines of conduct for a man of a wealthy class an oppressor
test1442,for a man of the poor working class the advantages and disadvantages will be the same but with a great increase of disadvantages
test1443,"say, you know something?"
test1444,look from a nickel plated flashlight to a car jack and spark plug
test1445,no one who needs a job ban that's jake harris
test1446,ok you said
test1447,only why didn't you ask him yourself
test1448,mike became uneasy and fished it in an elastic band out of his pocket made a flick of a paper and sent it soaring out into em street
test1449,well he admitted i did.
test1450,chris asked and for the first time that day the day's heavy weight he carried within him lifted and lightened a little.
test1451,think he really needs it. you pursued.
test1452,he would have liked to get the job for jakey who needed it but somehow the task of facing mister wicker especially now that the light
test1453,mike's expression changed to what once was to one of triumph but gris was only partially encouraged
test1454,bet you ain't goin' after all turnin' down him
test1455,mike was standing on the corner.
test1456,oh shocks!
test1457,chris started off once more passing a bleak little victorian church perched on the hill above mister worker's house
test1458,an empty lot cut into by church lane gave a look of isolation to the el shaped brick building that served mister whicker as both houses in place
test1459,the longer wing toward the back got a back door that opened on a water street the space between the house in washington avenue had been made into a neat
test1460,a livid yellow stained the horizon beyond the factories and clay clouds lowered and tumbled above.
test1461,the air was growing chill and chris decided to finish the job.
test1462,all at once you wondered how his mother was and everything in him pierced and tightened itself
test1463,at the foot of the hill he reached the house
test1464,there were three things that always caught his eye amid the litter of dusty pieces
test1465,on the left the coil of rope in the centre the model of a sailing ship in a green glass bottle and on the right the wooden statue of a
test1466,but the name still showed at the prow and many a time chris safe in home and bed had sailed imaginary voyages in the mirabelle
test1467,he had never seen any one go into mr. worker's shop. now he thought of it.
test1468,how then did he live and what did he ever sell?
test1469,a sudden car horn and walk from this dream.
test1470,of many times you have examined mr. wickers window and poured over the rope the ship and the nautical boy he had never gone into mr
test1471,so now alone until someone should answer the bell they looked eagerly if uneasily around him
test1472,what with the one window in the lower end outside the long narrow shop was somber
test1473,heavy hand yon beams crossed it from one side to the other
test1474,mister jorker's back being toward the source of light chris could not see his face
test1475,the double fans and minute ripples breaking from eye corner to temple and joining with those over the cheekbones were drawn into the horizontal lines across the dome
test1476,little tufts of white fuzz above the ears were all that remained of the antiquarian's hair but what drew and held chris's gaze were
test1477,chris blinked and looked again yes they were still there
test1478,chris swalloped his voice came back to him
test1479,"yes sir, you said."
test1480,i saw your sign and i know a boy who needs the job.
test1481,"he's a school made of mine,"
test1482,jacky harris's name isn't and he really needs the job.
test1483,i i just wondered if the place was still open
test1484,what he saw was a fresh cheeked lad tall for thirteen sturdy with sincerity and good humor in his face and something sensitive and appealing about his eyes
test1485,he guesses there must be a lively fire in that room beyond.
test1486,would that interfere with jay geeks getting the job sir?
test1487,but even as he slowly turned the thought pierced his mind why had you not seen the reflection of the headlights of the cars moving up around the quarter of
test1488,the rooms seemed overly still
test1489,then in that second he turned and faced about
test1490,the waua bowl window was there before him and three objects he liked showing frosty the moonlight that poured in from across the water
test1491,across the water where was the freeway
test1492,it was no longer there nor were the high walls and smokestacks of factories to be seen
test1493,the warehouses were still there.
test1494,flabbergasted and breathless chris was unaware that he had moved closer to appear out the window in every direction
test1495,no electric signs no lamp posts streets
test1496,where the people's drug store stood but half an hour before rose the ruins of what was evidently an inn
test1497,a court yard was first lit by flaring torture two showing a swinging sign hung on a post
test1498,the post was plenished at the wit of what was now a broad and money road
test1499,a coach with its top piled high with luggage stamped to a halt beside the flagged court yard
test1500,they moved into the inn the coach rattled off to the stable
test1501,my window has a power for those few who are to see.
test1502,the learning of magic was by no means easy
test1503,he told his master at once about simon gosling his hoard of money and his hiding places for it
test1504,chris therefore threw himself into all the preliminaries in his task
test1505,one afternoon when he had returned after arrest to mister wucker's study he saw that there was something new in the room a bowl with a gold
test1506,what do i do first?
test1507,how have you improved my boy he exclaimed is now a time for you to try and this is as good a change as any
test1508,suppose i change and can't change back
test1509,mister worker waited patiently beside him for a few moments for christ to get up and get his courage
test1510,then there is nothing happen with a voice like a whip mr. wiggins said start at once
test1511,a sensation spread faster and faster
test1512,his head swam and he felt faint and a little little but he resisted through the final words
test1513,"he thought not, without a feeling of pride and commenced experimenting with his tail and fins with such enthusiasm and delight that some little time elapsed before mister"
test1514,seventy four book one. the return.
test1515,the figure shoes carved in some eastern style at curved up at pointing toes
test1516,then all that once the idea came to chris.
test1517,"if he was to be a magician, could he make this boy come to life?"
test1518,he squatted on his haunches examined the carved wood and figure attentively and felt convinced that once alive the boy would be an ideal and happy
test1519,but how did one change inanimate to animate?
test1520,gris got up and stole back to mister worker's door.
test1521,you heard that magician going up the spiral staircase to his room above and after changing himself to a mouse to slip under the door and see that the room
test1522,the afternoon raining before increased in storm
test1523,thus saw two hours before its time thunder snarls in the sky
test1524,certain elements were to be mixed and poured at the proper time
test1525,mr. worker began moving about upstairs the floorboards creaked squeak squeak and still chris could not leave until the founton f
test1526,with infinite caution chris closed the doors silently behind him and running lightly forward greeted the figure of the negro boy
test1527,it was as if the stiffness melted
test1528,under his eyes whitened folds of cloth became rich silk embroidered gleamed in its reality upon the coat and oh the face
test1529,the wooden grin loosened the large eyes turned the hand holding the hard bough of carved flowers moved then the bough fell
test1530,they went down to their quarters first
test1531,guess mr finney went to his quarters as i don't remember seeing him cross the door or come over that way at all
test1532,next ned silly was referred to the helm by elbert jones who took over ned went on down
test1533,it looks to me as if it could have been one of several people and i'll be switched if i know who i'll keep my eyes open
test1534,the mirabel bell was near ing to heatherton
test1535,we've watered in fresh stalls to tick on there.
test1536,chris lost no time as soon as he could do it without being noticed in hurrying down to his cabin
test1537,certainly my boy boomed up the captain's blue eyes abruptly keen in penetrating
test1538,mister vinny will be some time on deck we cannot be other than heard in here
test1539,his face rozed with nervousness that this might do not as an answer and he stood stiff and still before captain blizard
test1540,the captain sat forward in his chair looking at him for a long moment considering
test1541,then he said well i do not care for it i cannot say i do
test1542,this ship is more to me than wife or mother or family
test1543,and paused fingering his lower lip looking sideways in a reflective fashion at christ standing before him
test1544,we shall say no more but i trust you understand the responsibility you have.
test1545,the ship its cargo and its men will be in your hands
test1546,yes sir i think i can do it safely or i should not try sir
test1547,captain blizzard's round pink face creased in its winning smile
test1548,he then went on to describe what else was to follow the covering of the ship with leaves to make it blend with its surroundings
test1549,camouflage was not a word the captain or any one of his time you had yet understood
test1550,what can be said during that time sir chris stout ask
test1551,i am somewhat skilled in medicaments i have to be as captain of a ship and the crew know it.
test1552,i shall say that you are in my own cabin so that i can care for you
test1553,not since he had left mr. wucker and chris felt such confidence as he did in the words and actions of captain blizzard
test1554,he knew now that his absence for as long as he had to be away would be covered up and satisfactorily accounted for
test1555,their conversation had taken some little while.
test1556,in churchyards john
test1557,i knew well enough that he might be carried thousands of miles in the box car locked in perhaps without water or food
test1558,i am sure i kissed lady and i've had terrible moments since when i seem to remember kissing mr jameson too in the excitement
test1559,fortunately wonner on the detective were keeping bachelor hall in the lodge
test1560,out of deference to lydia they washed their dishes once a day and a concocted queer messes according to their several abilities
test1561,miss innes he said stopping me as i was about to go to my room upstairs how are you nervous tonight
test1562,i have none i said happily
test1563,i mean he persisted do you feel as though you could go through with something rather unusual
test1564,the most unusual thing i can think of would be a peaceful night
test1565,something is going to occur he said
test1566,put on heavy shoes and some old dark clothes and make up your mind not to be surprised at anything
test1567,lily was sleeping the sleep of the just when i went upstairs and i hunted out my things cautiously
test1568,they were chuckling confidantly together but when i came down they seized
test1569,there were a few preparations to be made the logs to be gone over winters to be instructed as renewed vigilance and then after extinguishing the hall light
test1570,i ask no questions
test1571,once only somebody spoke and then it was an enigmatic phrase with a profanity from doctor steuart when he ran into a wire fence
test1572,i always know what i expect
test1573,the doctor was puffing somewhat when we finally came to a halt
test1574,i confess that just that minute even sunny side seemed a cheerful spot
test1575,in spite of myself i drew my breathing sharply
test1576,it was alex armed with two long handled spades
test1577,the doctor kept a keen lookout but no one appeared
test1578,there's one thing sure i'll not be suspected of complacency
test1579,a doctor is generally supposed to be a handy yardman bearing folks then a titching them up
test1580,i held onto him frantically and somehow i got terry looked down
test1581,but how am i to get over the ten or twelve days that must yet elapse before they go
test1582,for none could jeer me as he has done oh
test1583,the word stirs me in the face like a guilty confession but it is true i hate him i hate him
test1584,i sometimes think i ought to give him credit for the good feeling he simulated so well and then again i think it is my duty to suspect him under
test1585,i have done well to record them minutely
test1586,they have taken themselves to their work i less divert my mind than to duplicate conversation i provided myself with a book
test1587,i am too well acquainted with your character and conduct to feel any real friendship for you and as i am without your talent for the simulation i cannot assume
test1588,upon purring this she turned scarlet and beat her lip
test1589,you may go millicent until following a while millicent point
test1590,ollie blythe elan continued she
test1591,ha you are suspicious
test1592,if i was suspicious i replied i should have discovered your infamy long before
test1593,i enjoy human long ramble as well as you i answered steadily fixing my eyes up on her and february happens to be one of my favourite resorts
test1594,she colored again excessively and remained silent pressing your finger against her cheeks and gazing into the fire
test1595,i watch her a few moments to feel of malevolent gratification then moving towards the door i calmly asked if she had anything more to say
test1596,yes yes
test1597,suppose i do
test1598,she paused in evident concurrence and perplexity mingled with anger she dare not show
test1599,i cannot pronounce what is dearer than life she murmured in a low hairy tone
test1600,if you are generous here is a fitting opportunity for the exercise of your magnanimity if you are proud here am i your rival rather acknowledge myself your
test1601,i shall not tell him
test1602,give me no thanks it is not for your sect i refrain
test1603,and millicent will you tell her
test1604,i will not for much that you should know infamy and disgrace of a relation
test1605,you use arts missus hushington but i can pardon you
test1606,how dare you mention his name to me
test1607,it seems very interesting love said he lifting his head and turning to where i stood ringing my hand in silent rage and anger it's rather long i look
test1608,the keys of your cabinet desk drawer and whatever else you possess say he rising and holding out his hand
test1609,the key of my desk in fact was at that moment in the dock and the others were attached to it
test1610,now then snered he we must have a confiscation of property
test1611,and putting the keys into his pocket he walked into the library
test1612,that and all replied master and the things were cleared away
test1613,mister huntington's then went upstairs
test1614,norton he's starting back she's very devil for spite
test1615,i didn't say i had broken it did i return him
test1616,i shall put you up in a small monthly allowance in future for your own private expenses and you wouldn't even trouble yourself anymore about my concerns i shall
test1617,and as for the household matters missus grubs must be very particular in keeping her accounts we must go up an entirely new plan
test1618,what great discovery have you made now mister hounington
test1619,i have attempted to defraud you
test1620,not in money matters exactly it seems but it's best to keep out of the way of temptation
test1621,here benson entered the candles and there followed the brief interval of silence i sitting still in my chair and he is standing with his back to the fire
test1622,i know that day after day such feelings return upon me
test1623,i try to look to him and raise my heart to heaven but it will flit to the dust
test1624,then hope i fear
test1625,mister and missus hawkinsley i've been seeing it to grow before a fortnight and as mister hawkins is still absent
test1626,no unless you can tell me what you want to expect him home
test1627,i can't you don't want him do you
test1628,it is a resolution you are formed long ago
test1629,we all have a bit of a liking for him at the bottom of our hearts though we can't respect him
test1630,no i'd rather be like myself than as i am
test1631,never mind my plain speaking said i it is from the best of motives
test1632,but tell me should you wish your sons to be like mister huntingdon or even like yourself
test1633,oh no i could not understand that
test1634,fire and fury
test1635,now don't force yourself into a tempest at the ted
test1636,but hang it it's not my fault
test1637,not years for she's only five and twenty
test1638,what do you make of me and the children to be sure that were hurt death between them
test1639,i know they are bless them
test1640,it followed me into the library
test1641,i sought otton to put into his hands two of millicent's letters one dated from london and written during one of his wildest seasons of
test1642,the former was full of trouble and anguish not accusing him but deeply regretting his connection with his profligate companions abusing mister grimsby and
test1643,i've been a cursed rascal god knows said he as he gave it an ugly squeeze but you see if i don't make a man for it
test1644,if you intend to reform invoke god's blessing is mercy in this aid not its curse
test1645,god help me then for i'm sure i need it
test1646,where is millicent
test1647,nay not i said he turning around and pushing it towards me
test1648,millicent flew to thank me overwhelming its gratitude

test1653,there was a very natural savagery and jection there and a wild lurch in his yellow eyes rachel sat down

test1660,"there was nothing very brotherly in his look as he purred into a pale, sharp-cheeked face during the process."
test1661,there don't mind me she said sharply and getting up she looked down at her dress and thin shoes and seeming to recollect herself she took the candle
test1662,and she threw back her veil and going hurriedly to the toilet mechanically surveyed herself in the glass.
test1663,"rachel lee, rachel lee, what are you now?"
test1664,i'll stay here that is in the drawing room she answered and the face was withdrawn.
test1665,he slacked his space and tapped sharply at the little window of that most modest post office at which the young ladies in the pony carriage had pulled up

test1672,the act said that in case of difference of opinion there must be a ballot
test1673,he went up to the table and striking it with his finger ring he shouted loudly a bell
test1674,he was shouting for the very coarse sergey ivanovitch had proposed but it was evident that he hated him and all his party and this feeling
test1675,shouts were raised and for a moment all was confusion so that the marshal of the province had to call for order a bell
test1676,we shed our blood for our country.
test1677,the confidence of the monarch no checking of the accounts of the marshal he is not a cashier but that's not the point
test1678,votes please beee
test1679,they express the most implacable hatred
test1680,living did not in the least understand what was a matter and he marveled at the passion with which it was disputed whether or not the decision about fl
test1681,he forgot as sergey ivanovich explained to him afterwards this sibyllism that it was necessary for the public good to get rid of the
test1682,but levin forgot all that and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons for whom he had a respect in such an unpleasant and vicious
test1683,to escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the fresher's bar
test1684,he particularly liked the way one grey whiskered waiter who showed his corn for the other younger ones and was jested at by them was teaching them how
test1685,living in advance but utterly forgetting what he was to do and much embarrassed he turned to sergey evanovich with the question where am i to put
test1686,says even a bit of a brown
test1687,that is a matter for each man's decision he said severely
test1688,having put it in he reflected that he ought have thrust his left hand too and so he thrust it in though too late and still more overcome with confusion

test1692,but the old party did not consider themselves conquered.
test1693,in reply snitkov spoke of the trust the noblemen of the province had placed in him the affections he had shown him which he did not
test1694,this expression in the marshall's face was particularly touching levon because only the day before he had been at his house about his trusty business and
test1695,if there are men younger and more deserving than i let them serve
test1696,and the marshal disappeared through a side door
test1697,they were to proceed immediately to the election
test1698,two noble gentlemen who had a weakness for strong drink had been made drunk by the patrons of snickett's and a third had been robbed of his

test1700,ledon did not care to eat and he was not smoking he did not want to join his own friends that is sebastian evanovitch
test1701,he went to the window and sat down scanning the groups and listening to what was being said around him
test1702,he's such a blank card
test1703,i have told him so but it makes no difference only think of it
test1704,these persons were unmistakably seeking a place where they could talk without being overheard
test1705,shall we go on your excellence fine champagne
test1706,last year at our district marshal nicola evanoviches
test1707,oh still just the same always a loss the land owner answered with a resigned smile but with an expression of serenity and conviction that so it must be
test1708,why what is there to understand
test1709,there is no meaning in it at all
test1710,then two one must keep up connections
test1711,it's a moral obligation of assault
test1712,and then to tell the truth there's one's own interest
test1713,they are proprietors of a sort but we are the landowners
test1714,that it may it be but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully
test1715,if we are laying out a garden planning one before the house you know and there you have a tree that stood centuries in the very spot old and n
test1716,well and how and what is your land doing
test1717,but one's work is strown for nothing
test1718,oh well one does it what would you have
test1719,and what's more the landowner went on leaning his elbows on the window and chatting on my son i must tell you has no taste for it
test1720,so there will be no one to keep it and yet one does it
test1721,we walked about the fields and the garden no sarah stonewall everything's well looked after but your gardens are neglected
test1722,to my thinking i'd cut down the line tree
test1723,here you have thousands of limes and each would make two good bundles of pack
test1724,you're married i heard said the landowner
test1725,"yes, it's rather strange he went on"
test1726,the landowner chuckled under his white moustaches
test1727,why don't we cut down our parks for timber
test1728,sed eleven returning to a thought that rudd struck him
test1729,there is a class instinct too of what one ought and ought not to do
test1730,there's the peasants too i wander at them sometimes any good peasant tries to take all the land he can
test1731,without a return to add a simple loss
test1732,when he came from the bath praklos visited him again
test1733,but harmon was not in the mood to share a joyous revel and he frankly said so although immediately after his return he had accepted the invitation to
test1734,she would appear herself at dessert and the banquet must therefore begin at an unusually early hour
test1735,so the artist found himself obliged to relinquish his opposition
test1736,the banquet was to begin in a few hours yet he could not let the day pass without seeing daphne and telling her the words of the oracle
test1737,he longed with ardent yearning for the sound of her voice and still more to unburden his sorely troubled soul to her
test1738,since his return from the oracle the fear that the rescued demeter might yet be the work of mercurius had again mastered him
test1739,the approval as well as the doubts which had arisen in others strengthened his opinion although even now he could not succeed in bringing it into harmony with the facts
test1740,then he went directly to the neighboring palace the queen might have appeared already and it would not do to keep her waiting
test1741,hither the merchant had been induced it is true to advance large sums of money to the queen but the loyal devotion which he showed to her royal husband
test1742,when harman entered the residences of the grammaeatis in the palace the guests had already assembled
test1743,the place by hammond's side which althea had chosen for herself would then be given up to arsenal
test1744,true an interesting conversation still had power to charm him but often during its continuance the full consciousness of his misfortune forced itself upon his mind for the
test1745,a stranger out of his own sphere he fell chilled among these closely united men and women to whom naughtie bound him save the presence of the
test1746,crates had really been invited in order to win him over to the queen's cause but charming fair harriet nix had been commissioned by the conspir
test1747,his son had been the royal dame's first husband and she had deserted him to marry marcellus the aged king of thrace
test1748,the king's sister the object of his love cried harmoniously
test1749,we woman are only as old as we look and the leeches in tarrying woman of this beauty of forty practises arts which give her
test1750,the three most trustworthy ones are here amethysts the leichcrispis and the admirable proclamatis
test1751,let us hope that you will make this three leaf clover the luck promising four leaf one
test1752,your uncle two has often with praise worthy generosity helped osone in many an embarrassment
test1753,how long he kept you waiting from the first word concerning a work which justly transported the whole city with delight
test1754,when he did finally summon you he said things which must have warned you
test1755,that is going too far replied harman
test1756,he winked at her and made a significant gesture as he spoke and then informed the blind artist how graciously orchestra had remembered him when she heard of
test1757,the royal lady had inquired about him and his sufferings with almost sisterly interest and althea eagerly confirmed the statement
test1758,her mom listened to the parent's silence
test1759,the rodonian was just beginning to praise arsenal also as a special friend and connoisseur of the sculptures art when quires hamilton's fellow
test1760,yet what mattered it even if these miserable people considered themselves deceived and pointed the finger of scorn at him
test1761,a woman who yearns for the regard of all men and makes love a toy easily lessens the demands she imposes upon individuals
test1762,only even though love has wholly disappeared she still claims consideration and althea did not wish to lose hamilton's regard
test1763,how indifferent you look but i tell you her deep blue eyes flashed as she spoke that so long as you were still a genuine creating artist the case was
test1764,though so loud a denial is written on your face i persist in my conviction and that no idle delusion and snags me i can prove
test1765,it was nay it could have been nothing else that very spider
test1766,not a sound if you value your lives
test1767,to offer resistance would have been madness for even hamilton perceived by the loud clanking of weapons around them the greatly superior power of the enemy and they
test1768,was he to be led to the executioners block
test1769,what pleasure had life afforded him the blind man who was already dead to his art
test1770,are thou not to greet his sudden end as a boom from the immortals?
test1771,did it not spare him a humiliation as great and painful as could be imagined
test1772,whatever might await him he desired no better fate
test1773,if he had passed into annihilation he hermon wished to follow him thither an annihilation certainly meant redemption from pain and misery
test1774,but if he were destined to meet his virtuous and his mother in the world beyond the grave what had he not to tell them how sure he was
test1775,the power which delivered him over to death just at that moment was not nemesis no it was a kindly deity
test1776,yet it was no illusion that deceived him
test1777,again he heard the beloved voice and this time addressed not only him but with the utmost haste the commander of the soldiers
test1778,sometimes with touching in treaty sometimes with imperial command she protested after giving him her name that this matter could be nothing but an unfortunate mistake
test1779,lastly with earnest warmth she besought him before taking the prisoners away to permit her to speak to the commanding general philippus her father's guest who
test1780,cried harman in grateful agitation but she would not listen to him and follow the soldier whom the captain detail to guide her into the palace
test1781,to morrow you shall confess to me who treacherously directed you to this dangerous path
test1782,daphne again pleaded for the liberation of the prisoners but phillip's silence charged with a grave exclamation the order of the king
test1783,as soon as the captive artist was alone with a woman he loved he clasped her hand pouring forth in harmonious words of the most ardent gratitude
test1784,in spite of his deep mental distress he could have shouted aloud in his delight and gratitude
test1785,he might now have been permitted to bind forever to his life the woman who had just rescued him from the greatest danger but the confession he must make to
test1786,i love you and have loved you always
test1787,daphne exclaimed tenderly what more is needed
test1788,but harmon with winking head murmured to morrow i shall no longer be what i am now
test1789,then daphne raised her face to his asking so the demeter is the work of mercurius
test1790,what a terrible ordeal again awaits you
test1791,and i fool blind also in mind could be vexed with you for it
test1792,bring this before your mind and everything else that you must accept with it if you consent when the time arrives to become mine conceal in palety nothing
test1793,so acra intended to leave the city on one of his ships that very day
test1794,he himself on the way to expose himself to the malice and mockery of the whole city
test1795,his heart contracted painfully and his solicitude about his uncle's fate increased when philippe informed him that the conspirators had been arrested at the banquet
test1796,besides he knew that the object of his love would not part from him without granting him one last word
test1797,on the way his heart throbbed almost to bursting
test1798,even daphne's image and what threatened her father and with her at him was seated far into the background
test1799,he was appearing before his companions only to give truth it's just do
test1800,the egyptian obeyed and his master crossed the wide space strewn with sand and approached the stage which had been erected for the festive performances even
test1801,shouted his friend sartre in joyous surprise in the midst of his painful walk haramon
test1802,even while he believed himself to be the creator of the demeter he had been seriously troubled by the praise of so many critics because it had exposed him
test1803,honour to mercurial and his art but he trusted the noble feast hall assembly would pardon the unannounced deception and heaid his prayer for
test1804,afterward it was supposed that he was satisfied with a blood of oxen lamps and dogs and that in exchange for or in account of these sacrifices this
test1805,whether he was the creator of yourself and myself
test1806,whether and any prayer was ever answered
test1807,why did he create the intellectual inferior
test1808,why did he create the defaced and helpless why did he create the criminal the idiotic the insane
test1809,are the failures and obligation to their creator
test1810,is he responsible for all the wars that have been waged for all the innocent blood that has been shed
test1811,is he responsible for the centuries of slavery for the backs that have been scarred with lash for the babes that have been sold from the breasts of mothers
test1812,is this responsible for religious persecution for the inquisitor for the thumb screw and rack and for all the instruments of torture
test1813,did this get the cruel and vile to destroy the brave and virtuous
test1814,did he allow tyrants to shed a blood of patriots
test1815,can we conceive of a devil beseeming enough to prefer his enemies to his friends
test1816,how can we account for the wild beasts that devour human beings for the fanged serpents whose bite is death
test1817,how can we account for a world whose life feeds on life
test1818,did infinite wisdom intentionally produce the microscopic beasts that feed upon the optic nerve think of blinding a man to satisfy the appetite of a microbe
test1819,fear builds the altar and offers the sacrifice
test1820,fear erects the cathedral and bows the head of man in worship
test1821,lits religious and fearful tremblingly repeat his passage though he slay me yet will i trust him
test1822,can we say that he cared for the children of men
test1823,can we say that is mercy endured forever
test1824,do we prove his goodness by showing that he has opened the earth and swallowed thousands of his helpless children or that with the volcanoes he has overwhelmed them
test1825,was their goodness was their wisdom in this
test1826,or the superior raised to sign cut that they are not inferior
test1827,most people cling to the supernatural
test1828,if they give up one god they imagine an other
test1829,what is this power
test1830,man advances and necessarily advances to experience
test1831,a man wishing to go to a certain place comes to where the road divides
test1832,he has tried that road and knows that it is the wrong road
test1833,a child shone by the beauty of the flame grasped it with his dimpled hand
test1834,the power that works for righteousness had taught the child a lesson
test1835,it is a result.
test1836,it is insisted by these theologians and by many of the so called philosophers that this moral sense this sense of duty of obligation was important and that conscience
test1837,we live together in families tribes and nations
test1838,they are praised admired and respected
test1839,they are regarded as good that is to say as moral
test1840,the members who add to the misery of the family the tribe or the nation are considered bad mensters
test1841,the greatestest of human beings had said conscience is born of love
test1842,as people advance the remote consequences are perceived
test1843,the imagination is cultivated
test1844,a man puts himself in the place of another
test1845,the sense of duty becomes stronger more imperative
test1846,man judges himself
test1847,in all this there is nothing supernatural
test1848,man has deceived himself
test1849,has christianity done good
test1850,when the church had control were men made better and happier
test1851,what has religion done for hungary or ostrava
test1852,could these countries have been worse without religion?
test1853,could they have been worse had they had any other religion than christianity
test1854,what did christianity do for them
test1855,they hated pleasure
test1856,they muffled all the bells of gladness
test1857,the religion of the puritan was an unadulterated curse
test1858,the puritan believe the bible to be the word of god and this belief has always made those who held it cruel and wicked.
test1859,let me refer to just one fact showing the influence of a belief in the bible on human beings
test1860,the queen received the bible kissed it and pledged herself to diligently read thereon
test1861,in other words it was just as feinlich just as infamous as the catholic spirit
test1862,has the bible made the people of georgia kind and merciful
test1863,religion has been tried and in all countries in all times has failed
test1864,religion has always been the enemy of science of investigation and thought
test1865,religion has never made men free
test1866,it has never made man moral tempered industrious and honest
test1867,are christians more temperate nearer virtuous nearer honest than savages
test1868,can we cure disease by supplication
test1869,can we receive virtue or hanner as arms
test1870,religion rests on the idea that nature has a master and that this master will listen to prayer that this master punishes and rewards that he loves praise
test1871,we must have corn the stones
test1872,the structure must have a basin
test1873,if we build we must begin at the bottom
test1874,i have a theory and i have four cornerstones
test1875,the first stone is that matter substance cannot be destroyed cannot be annihilated
test1876,if these cordons are facts it follows as a necessity that matter and force are from and end to eternity that they can neither be increased nor diminished
test1877,it follows that nothing has been or can be created that there never has been or can be a creator
test1878,it follows that there could not have been any intelligence any design back of matter and force
test1879,i say what i think
test1880,every even has parents
test1881,that which has not happened could not
test1882,in the infinite chain wrists and can there be no broken no missing link
test1883,we now know that our first parents were not foreigners
test1884,we now know if we know anything that the universe is natural and that men and women have been naturally produced
test1885,we know the parts that life has travelled
test1886,we know the footsteps of advance they have been traced
test1887,for thousands of years men and women have been trying to reform the world
test1888,why have the reformers failed
test1889,they depend on the lord on luck and charity
test1890,they live by fraud and violence and bequith their vices to their children
test1891,failure seems to be the trademark of nature why
test1892,nature produced without purpose sustains without intention and destroys without thought
test1893,must the world forever remain the victim of ignorant passion
test1894,why should men and women have children that they cannot take care of children that are a burden and curses why
test1895,pasion is and always has been death
test1896,law can punish but it can neither reform criminals nor prevent crime
test1897,this cannot be done by talk or example
test1898,this is the solution of the whole question
test1899,this frees women
test1900,poverty and crime will be childish
test1901,it is far better to be free to leave the faults and barricades of fear to stand erect and face the future with a smile
test1902,there done far said the schoolmaster in a low key to the shwet out with your vitriol and mind your eye
test1903,the two monsters took off their shows and moved stealthily along keeping in the shadows of the houses
test1904,by means of this strategem they followed so closely that although within a few steps of sara and tom they did not hear them
test1905,sara and her brother having again passed by the tappi frank arrived close to the dilapidated house which was partly in ruins and its open
test1906,in an instant the schoolmaster with a leap resembling strength and agility the spring of a tiger seized sittingon with one hand by the throat and exclaimed your
test1907,no said the old brook tremblingly no not one ringing what a shame
test1908,tom simon did not lose his presence of mind during this scene rapidly and unexpectedly as it had occurred
test1909,o uah ah to lay a trap to catch us replied the thief
test1910,then addressing thomas seaton you know the plane of saint danielle
test1911,did you see in the cabaret we had just left for i know you again the man whom the charcoal man came to seek
test1912,cried the schoolmaster a thousand francs and i'll kill him.
test1913,witch i do not see his life replied sara to the schoolmaster
test1914,let us go and meet him
test1915,all by it will pay for looking after.
test1916,well my wife shall be there said the schoolmaster you will tell her what you want and i shall see
test1917,in the plain of sainte catherine
test1918,between saint and the road of revolt at the end of the road agreed
test1919,he had forgotten the address of the self styled pan painter
test1920,the fiaqua started
test1921,france who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone
test1922,my very good friend an excellent neighbour replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exigencies
test1923,my father the count de morèshev although though of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of france and madrid and i anxiously place the
test1924,i can scarcely credit it
test1925,then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realise plans that i have long
test1926,shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour in quiet the count only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punct
test1927,so be it then replied the counts and extending his hand towards the calendar suspended near the chimney piece he said today is the twenty first of february and
test1928,i reside in my father's house but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard and tail is separated from the main building
test1929,now then set the count returning his tablets to his pocket make yourself perfectly easy the hand of your time piece will not be more accurate in marking the time
test1930,that depends when do you leave?
test1931,for france no for venice i shall remain in italy for another year or two
test1932,then we shall not meet in paris
test1933,i fear i shall not have that honour
test1934,well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of a young man allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey
test1935,what is the matter asked abbot of france when they had returned to their own apartments you seem more than commonly thoughtful
test1936,i will confess to you arthur replied france the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with
test1937,did you ever meet him previously to coming hither?
test1938,upon my honour then listen to me
test1939,he dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the bro
test1940,then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the coliseum between the count and vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of
test1941,but said france the coquartian bandits that were among the crew of his vessel
test1942,"why, really, the thing seems to me simple enough!"
test1943,talking of countries replied france of what countries the counts what is his native tongue when does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early
test1944,certainly these are questions that sit in your place i should like to have answered
test1945,my dear france replied abraham when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the count's assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend
test1946,what are his means of existence what is his birthplace of what countries are he a native
test1947,i confess he asked me none no he merely came and freed me from the hands of senior vampir where i can assure you in spite of all my
test1948,and this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on albert's
test1949,"well said frances with a sigh do as you please, dear my dearest count for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation"
test1950,"and now, my dear frances, let us talk of something else."
test1951,then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination albert morse could follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close
test1952,shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground
test1953,at a quarter to ten a valiant entered he composed with a little room named john and who only spoke english all albert's establishment although the cook
test1954,wait then during the day tell roza that when i leave the opera i will sup with her as she wishes
test1955,very well at half past ten
test1956,is the count up yet?
test1957,the dale left the room.
test1958,"good morning, rufus, good morning, said albert your punctuality really alarms me"
test1959,"you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was half past,"
test1960,"no, no, my dear fellow, do not confound our plans,"
test1961,"yes, he has not much to complain of bourges is the capital of charles the seventh."
test1962,it is for that reason you see me so early
test1963,i returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep but my head ached and i got up to have a ride for an hour.
test1964,pests i will do nothing of the kind the moment they come from government you would find them exasperable
test1965,besides that that does not concern the home but the financial department
test1966,about what about the papers?
test1967,in the entire political world of which you are one of the leaders
test1968,they say that it is quite fair and that sewing so much red you ought to reap a little blue
test1969,"come, come, that is not bad, said lucius."
test1970,with your talents you would make your fortune in three or four years.
test1971,the gentleman had not needed to sit down to become interested apparently he had taken up the volume of a table as soon as he came in and standing there
test1972,that has an unfaltering sound for me said the young man
test1973,she is willing to risk that
test1974,just as i am the visitor enquired presenting himself with rather a workaday aspect
test1975,he was tall and lean and dressed through in black his shirt collar was low and wide and the triangle of linen a little crumpled exhibited by the
test1976,in spite of this decoration the young man looked poor is poor as a young man could look who had such a fine head and such magnificent eyes
test1977,those of bazil's ransom were dark deep and glowing his head had a character of elevation which fairly added to his stature it was a head to be
test1978,these things the eyes especially with their smoldering fire might have indicated that he was to be a great american statesman or on the other hand they
test1979,and yet the reader who likes a complete image who desires to read with the senses as well as with the reason is intently not to forget that he
test1980,and he took up his hat vagily a soft black hat with a low crown and an immense straight brim
test1981,well so it is they are all witches and wizards mediums and spirit rappers and roaring radicals
test1982,if you are going to dine with her you had better know it oh murder
test1983,he looked at missus luna with intelligent incredulity
test1984,she was attractive and impertinent especially the latter
test1985,have you been in europe?
test1986,no i haven't been anywhere
test1987,she hates it she would like to abolish it
test1988,this last remark he made at venice for he had naturally not devoted in his speculation whatever to missus lusina
test1989,are you very ambitious you look like you wear
test1990,and missus luna added that now she was back she didn't know what she should do
test1991,didn't even know what one had come back for
test1992,besides oliver didn't want her in boston and didn't go through the form of saying so
test1993,that was one comfort with olive she never went through any forms
test1994,she stood there looking consciously and rather seriously and missed a ransom a smile of exceeding faintness played about her lips it was just perceptible enough to light
test1995,her voice was low and agreeable a cultivated voice and she extended a slender white hand to her visitor her remarked with some solemnity he felt a certain
test1996,he observed that miss chancellor's hand was at once called in limp she merely placed it in her without exerting the smallest pressure
test1997,i shall be very late we'll be going to a theatre party that's why we dine so early
test1998,missus louisa's familiarity extended even to her sister she remarked to miss chansley that she looked as if she had got up for a sea
test1999,purnassan announced this fact to himself as if he had made a great discovery but in reality he had never been so beauch as at
test2000,the woman he had hitherto known had been mainly of his own soft climb and it was not often they exhibited the tendency he detected and curiously
test2001,ransome was pleased with the vision of that remedy it must be repeated that he was very provident
test2002,he was sorry for her but he saw in a flash that no one could help her that was what made her tragic
test2003,she could not defend herself against a rich admiration a kind of tenderness of envy of anyone who had been so happy as to have that opportunity
test2004,his family was ruined they had lost their slaves their property their friends and relations their home had tasted of all the cruelty of defeat
test2005,the state of mississippi seemed to him the state of despair so he surrendered the remnants of his patrimony to his mother and sisters and at nearly
test2006,it was in the female line as baleys ransom had written in answering her letter with a good deal of form and flourish he spoke as if they
test2007,if it had been possible to send missus ransom money or even clothes she would have liked that but she had no means of assuring how such an
test2008,oliver had a fear of everything but her greatest fear was of being afraid
test2009,she had erected it into a sort of rule of conduct that whenever she saw a risk she was to take it and she had frequent humiliations at finding
test2010,she was perfectly safe after writing to basilus ransom and indeed it was difficult to see what he could have done to her except thank her he was only
test2011,he was too simple too mississippian for that she was almost disappointed
test2012,of all things in the world contention was most sweet to her why it is hard to imagine who always caused her tears headaches a day or two in bed
test2013,miss chancellor himself thought so much on the vital subject would not she make a few remarks and give them some of her experiences?
test2014,how did the ladies and beachcombers feel about the ballot?
test2015,perhaps she could speak for them more than for some others
test2016,with her immense sympathy for reform she found herself so often wishing that reformers were a little different
test2017,oh ill have hated to hear that fine avenue talked about as if it was such a remarkable place and to live there were a proof of wondrous glory
test2018,all sorts of inferior people lived there and so brilliant a woman as missus fender who lived at braddockbury but not to mix things up
test2019,she knew her place in the boston hierarchy and it was not what missus franklin supposed that there was a want of perspective in talking to her
test2020,she wished to wake in another field she had long been preoccupied with the romance of the people
test2021,this might seem one of the most accessible of pleasures but in point of fact she had not found it so
test2022,charlie was a young man in a white overcoat and a paper collar it was for him in the last analysis that they cared much the most
test2023,ol' chancellor wondered how missus sanderson would treat their branch of the question
test2024,if it have been necessary we are prepared to take certain steps to conciliate the shrinking
test2025,our movement is for all it would also be the most delicate ladies.
test2026,raised the standard among them and bring me your thousand names
test2027,a look after the details as well as the booklets missus farrenan added in a tone as explicit as could be expected of such a woman
test2028,said oliphant chancellor with a face which seemed to plead for a remission of responsibility.
test2029,i want to be near them to help them.
test2030,it was one thing to choose for herself but now that the representative of the enfranchisement of their sex from every form of bondage had chosen
test2031,the unhappiness of women
test2032,they were her sisters they were her own and the day of their delivery had dawned
test2033,this was the only sacred cause this was the great the dust revolution it was triumph it was sweep everything before it it must exact from the other the brutal
test2034,"there would be names of women weak, insulted, persecuted but devoted in every parts of their being to the cause and asking no better fate than to"
test2035,it was not clear to this interesting girl in what manner such a sacrifice as this last would be required of her that she sold a matter through a kind
test2036,when miss bird's eye approached it transfigured her familiar her comic shape and made the poor little humanitarian hack seem already a martyr
test2037,oliver chancellor looked at her with love remembered that she had never in her long and rewarded weary life had a thought an impulse for herself
test2038,she had been consumed by the passion of sympathy it had crumbled her into as many crevices as an old glazed distended glove
test2039,"but excuse me, didn't you figure on doing some detecting and giving up fishing?"
test2040,shag with the freedom of an old servant stood looking at his master as if not quite understanding the new twist the affairs had taken
test2041,i'm going off fishing. i may not catch anything and may not want to after i get there.
test2042,"get ready shag yes, sir,"
test2043,and having put himself in a fair way as he had hoped to solve some of the problems connected with the darcy case colonel ashley went down
test2044,"pincus and donovan, haven't they, carl? yes,"
test2045,carl was too much engaged in watching the blue smoke curl lazily upward from his cigar just then to say more.
test2046,"are you going to work on that case, colonel?"
test2047,"but he hadn't any more to do with it, than that cat."
test2048,"perhaps not, admitted colonel ashley."
test2049,we've got our man and that's all we want.
test2050,"you're on that arsey case they tell me in a way, yes."
test2051,"i'm working in the interest of the young men,"
test2052,it's just one of them coincidences like.
test2053,busted his head in with a heavy candlestick one of a pair.
test2054,"gad, explained the colonel,"
test2055,the very pair i was going to buy
test2056,"look here, colonel, do you know anything about this?"
test2057,and the detective's professional instincts got the upper hand of his friendliness not the least in the world not as much as you do was the cool answer
test2058,i happened to see those candlesticks in the window of single-fisted shop the other day and i made my mind to buy them when i had a
test2059,now i'm afraid i won't but how did it happen?
test2060,"but i don't know whether that's his first or his last name, anyhow. he had a partner named sherry lee."
test2061,"anyway he and fit didn't get along very well, it seems."
test2062,neighbours often heard them scraping a lot and this afternoon they went at it again and hot and heavy.
test2063,to dark a man went in to buy a lamp
test2064,he found the place without a light in it stumbled over something on the floor and there was ali's body with the head bashed in and this heavy
test2065,"sure, held so tight we could hardly get it out."
test2066,maybe the fight was about who owns the watch for the dagos talked in their foreign language and none of the neighbors could tell what they were saying i
test2067,"and the watch, have you it yes, it's here."
test2068,"that's the watch, announced the headquarters detective, reaching in for it going in, see?"
test2069,"you're not as shrieking as all that, are you? just because it was in a dead man's hands and a woman's?"
test2070,"and donaldson's voice was plainly skeptical,"
test2071,"yes, it may have some rough edges on it."
test2072,and i've read enough about tumors to know the danger i'd advise you to be careful.
test2073,"if you don't mind, i should like to examine this a bit."
test2074,"before the big wind in ireland, suggested thong, with the nod of an irish compatriot, slightly, he'll have the colon"
test2075,"that's right, agreed the colonel as he continued to move his magnifying glass over the surface of the still ticking watch."
test2076,and a close observer might have observed that he did not touch his bare fingers to the time piece but poked it about and touched it here and there
test2077,"and donald, take a friend's advice and don't be too free with that watch too free with it,"
test2078,ask the surprise detective yes.
test2079,"don't scratch yourself on it, whatever you do why not?"
test2080,simply because this watch
test2081,someone out here to see you
test2082,"alright, be there in a second."
test2083,shingofat was the painting answer.
test2084,i want to talk over darcy's case with you the colonel had said and the two had talked had thought had talked again and now were silent
test2085,what are the chances of getting him off legally if we go at it from a negative standpoint asked the colonel?
test2086,"rather a hypothetical question, controller but i should say it might be a fifty to fifty proposition"
test2087,at best he would get off with the scotch verdict of not proving but he doesn't want that nor do i
test2088,and you i don't want it either.
test2089,but i want to know just where we stand now i know.
test2090,but i need to do a little more smoking out first now i wanted to think
test2091,"if you'll excuse me, i'll pretend to fishing and i may catch something."
test2092,in fact i have a feeling that i will land my fish.
test2093,"i'd recommend him to you instead of blackstone thanks, slapped kenneth."
test2094,what is it? perhaps i can help you?
test2095,"the old adage of two heads, you know?"
test2096,"yes, it still holds good."
test2097,no allomony replied the colonel puzzled yes just that
test2098,and there's no reason you shouldn't know.
test2099,chuckled the colonel as he skillfully played the luckless trout now struggling to get loose from the hook.
test2100,and when the fish was landed panting on the grass and shank had been roused from his slumber to slip the now limp fish into the
test2101,"the reason she asked no alimony inquired kenneth,"
test2102,no i wasn't thinking of that.
test2103,"however, don't think i'm not interested in your case i've finished enough for today"
test2104,"well, i don't know that you can."
test2105,"it isn't generally known when the lawyer that the hotel keeper's wife has left him,"
test2106,it was one of what at first might be called refined cruelty on her husband's part degenerating gradually into that of a baser sort
test2107,you don't mean that large struck her that there was physical abuse do you as the colonel that's what he did
test2108,the colonel did not disclose the fact that it was no news to him.
test2109,arnold griffith's statement was being unexpectedly confirmed.
test2110,he remembered that sydney and griffith had once been in love with each other.
test2111,she said he had struck her more than once and she could stand it no longer.
test2112,because larch made no defence.
test2113,"larch, refusing to appear practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation."
test2114,so i had to let her have her way and we did not ask the court for money though i had no such squeamish feelings when it came
test2115,no but he will or i'll sue him and get judgement oh he'll pay all right
test2116,and it takes all sorts of persons to make it up.
test2117,"still i would like to know,"
test2118,the murderer of missus darcy had some time ago been shifted off the front page though it would get back there when the young jullier was
test2119,"it had a double reputation, so to speak."
test2120,grave and even reverence the conveniences assembled in its ball room and politicians of the upper if not better class were frequently seen in its dining room or
test2121,"larche himself was a peculiar character,"
test2122,"in a smaller place, he would have been called a saloon keeper,"
test2123,"and it was this man rich, it was said handsome certainly that thomas rutherford had married"
test2124,to this was the answer whispered money.
test2125,"and in, it was a way it was true."
test2126,she also saw an opportunity of paying old debts and reaping some rewards
test2127,"after the marriage which was a brilliant and gay woman, if not happy the large hotel it could hardly be called a home became the scene of many fest"
test2128,then it was said of large that soon after the echoes of the wedding hymns had died away he had begun to treat his wife with refined cruelty that
test2129,but it was noted that the older and more conservative families were less often represented and when they were it was by some of the younger members whose reputations
test2130,it wouldn't do you know after that story came out for me and the vice chancellor who sat in the case as well as other judges and members of
test2131,"meanwhile, colonel ashley was a very busy man and to none did he tell very much about his activities he saw darcy frequently at the jail"
test2132,"don't worry, it will come out all right."
test2133,"i'm going to rectify them, but it will take time."
test2134,"it's hard for miss mason too, although she's bearing up like a major."
test2135,"so king god bale, who put it up,"
test2136,it was high marsh.
test2137,they took harry away a while ago.
test2138,but his are pretty uncertain to be in just the same.
test2139,only that i darsy hesitated and grew red
test2140,"good evening, colonel. he called geily. will you join me in a welsh rabbit?"
test2141,"thank you, no."
test2142,i'm afraid my digestion isn't quite up to that as i've had to cut out my fishing of late.
test2143,now as to certain matters in the store on the morning of the murder
test2144,"the stopped clocks, for instance, have you any theory?"
test2145,there were three of them the centre figure being of that harry king and he was very much intoxicated
test2146,"that is not always, but sometimes it happened to be so now."
test2147,i beg your pardon he said in the cultured tones he knows so well how to use yet of what he made so little use of late
test2148,i said where have you been remarked the other we've missed you
test2149,i said i was golfing he went on exceedingly distinctly though with an effort.
test2150,"why polonius, as someone asked?"
test2151,because dear friend replied king softly he somewhat resembles a certain person here who talks too much but who is not so wise as he thinks
test2152,there was a rattle of coins on the mahogany bars king sought to disentangle a single bill from the wadded up currency in his pocket
test2153,it's it's an odd coin an old roman one that missus darcy had an inner private collection kept in the jewelry store safe was the whispered
test2154,i went over them the day and noticed some were missing though i saw them all when i paid a visit to her just a short time before she was
test2155,"that was her's when on the jowr,"
test2156,"now harry king has exclaimed, commander albert,"
test2157,even the sun came out pale and watery at noon
test2158,the colds and drudgery of the rainy months vanished
test2159,asked worker last sunday you did it when the youngers
test2160,"well, didn't they shoot us? one man exhibited his arm in a sling."
test2161,have i got something to remember them by the devils?
test2162,who are you to destroy the legal government who is leon a german
test2163,who are you a counter revolutionary a provocateur they be loathed at him
test2164,you call yourselves the people of russia but you are not the people of russia
test2165,the peons are the people of russia wait until the peons
test2166,we know what the priests will say aren't they working men like ourselves
test2167,this man has specially welcomed the call to a congress of pensioners
test2168,this last were the young generation who had been serving in the army
test2169,whereupon the old executive committee left the hall
test2170,down with him they shrieked
test2171,fearful talmud cries down with the pallish cheviot key
test2172,upon my return i visited smalley no such accusation was made against me there after a brief conversation i left and that's all let any one present make
test2173,meanwhile the question of the status of the executive committee was agitating all minds
test2174,by declaring the assembly extraordinary conference it had been planned to block the repeal of the executive committee
test2175,but this worked both ways the local social revolutionary decided that if the congress had no power over the executive committee then the executive committee had no power over the
test2176,on the twenty seventh occurred the debate on the land question which revealed the differences between the agrarian program of the bolsheviks and the left socialist revolution

test2178,followed him lenin listen to now with absorbing intensity
test2179,the first stage was the crushing of autocracy and the crushing of the power of the industrial capitalist and the landowners whose interests are closely related
test2180,the tumours and zemstoves were dropped
test2181,he knew that an agreement with the polische was being discussed but he did not know that it had been concluded
test2182,he spoke to the rum convention
test2183,"the villages will save us in the end,"
test2184,but the present movement is international and that is why it is invincible
test2185,the will of millions of workers is now concentrated in the hall
test2186,a new humanity will be born of this war
test2187,i greet you with the christianity of a new russian life and freedom.
test2188,then i took up a great stone from among the trees and coming up to him smote him there with all my might and crushed in his skull as
test2189,behold a ship was making for the island through the dashing sea and clashing waves
test2190,hearing this i was so troubled remembering what i had before suffered from the ape kind
test2191,upon this he brought me a cotton bag and gave it to him he said take this bag and fill it with pebbles from the beach and go
test2192,do as they do and be like thou shalt gain what may further thy return voyage to thy native land
test2193,then he carried me to the beach where i filled my bag with pebbles large and small and presently we saw a company of folk issue from the
test2194,to these he committed me commending me to their care and saying this man is a stranger so take him with you and teach him how to gather that
test2195,now sleeping under these trees were many eaves which when we saw us rose and fled from us and swarmed up among the branches whereupon my companions
test2196,we weighed anchor and shirazard perceived the dawn of the day and ceased to say her permitted say
test2197,when it was the five hundred and ninety fifth night
test2198,and ceased not to sail until we arrive safely at vasara
test2199,there i abode a little and then went on to bagdad where i entered my quarter and found my house and gathered with my family and saluted
test2200,after which i shall return to my old merry way of life and forgot all i had suffered in the great profit and gain i had made
test2201,next morning as soon as it was light he prayed the dawn prayer and after blessing hammam the cream of all creatures he took himself to the house of
test2202,here i found a great ship ready for sea and full of merchants and notables who had with them goods of price so i embarked my bales there
test2203,happily amongst you is one righteous whose prayers the lord will accept
test2204,presently the ship struck the mountain and broke up and all and everything on board of her were plunged into the sea
test2205,but it burns in their bellies so they cast it up again and congeal on the surface of the water whereby its color and quantities are changed
test2206,each that died we washed and shrouded in some of the clothes and linen cast ashore by the tides and after little the rest of my
test2207,but there is majesty and there is no might save in all the glorious the great
test2208,when it was the five hundred and sixty first night
test2209,then saying for myself i set to work collecting a number of pieces of chinese and cornmeal elous wood and i bound them together with ropes from the
test2210,land after land shalt thou see and find but no other life upon thy wish shall wait fret not thy soul in thy thoughts all woes shall end or sooner
test2211,i rode my conveyance into the place which was intensely dark and the current carried the raft with it down the underground channel
test2212,and i threw myself down upon my face on the raft by reason of the narrowness of the channel whilst the streams cease not to carry me along knowing
test2213,when i awake at last i found myself in the light of heaven and opening my eyes i saw myself in a broad stream and the raft moored to
test2214,but i was delighted at my escape from the river
test2215,when they saw i understood them not and made them no answer one of them came forward and said to me in arabic peace be with you my brother
test2216,oh my brother answered he we are husbandmen and tilters of the soil who came out to water our fields and plantations and finding thee asleep on
test2217,i answered for ala's sake oh my lord ere i speak give me somewhat to eat for i am starving and after ask me what thou wilt
test2218,when it was the five hundred and sixty second night
test2219,she said it hath reached me auspicious king that sinbad the sea man continued when i landed and found myself amongst the indian and aboriginals and
test2220,so i consoled with the chief of the islanders and they paid me the utmost respect
test2221,so i rose without stay or delay and kissed the king's hand and acquainted him with my longing to set out with the merchants for that i pined
test2222,whitho thou art thy own master yet if it be thy will to abide with us on our head and nays be it for thy gladd
test2223,by allah are my lord answered i thou hast indeed overwhelmed me with thy favours and well doings but i weary for a sight of my friends
test2224,then i took leave of him and of all my intimates and acquaintances in the island and embarked with the merchant saphed
test2225,he asked me when they came and i said to him by allah a commander of the faithful i know not the name of the city nor the way
test2226,for state presessions a throne is set for him upon a huge elephant eleven quarts high and upon this he sitteth having his great lords and
test2227,his letter hath shown me this and as for the majesty of his dominion thou hast told us what now hath died witness
test2228,presently my friends came to me and i distributed presence among my family and gave arms and largesse after which i yielded myself to jointures and enjoyment
test2229,such then oh my brothers is the history of what befell me in my sixth voyage and to morrow incline
test2230,i will tell you the story of my seventh and last voyage which is still more wondrous and marvelous than that of the first six
test2231,when it was the five hundred and sixty third night
test2232,she said it hath reached me a most auspicious king that when sinbad the seaman had related the history of what befell him in his sixth
test2233,the seventh voyage of sinbad the sailor
test2234,know o company that after my return from my sixth voyage which brought me abundant profit i resumed my former life in all possible joints and enjoyment and mirth
test2235,so having made up my mind i packed up in bales a quantity of precious stuff suitable for sea trade and repaired with them from bagdad city to
test2236,but the captain arose and tightened his girdle tucked up his skirts and after taking refuge with ala from satan the stoned climbed to the
test2237,this he set in a sauce wet with a little water and after waiting a short time smelt and tasted it and then he took out of the chest
test2238,a second fish read its appearance and which we had seen not more monstrous
test2239,when suddenly a violent squall of wind rose and smote the ship which rose out of the water and settled upon a great reef the horn of monsters
test2240,unfortunately there could be no doubt or misconception as the platterbe's guilt
test2241,he had not only plighted guilty but had expressed his intention of repeating his escapade in other directions as soon as circumstances permitted throughout the trial he was
test2242,the jury could not possibly find that the prisoner had not deliberately and intentionally blown up the albert hall the question was could they find any exsangu
test2243,of course any sentence which the law might feel compelled to inflict would be followed by an immediate pardon but it was highly desirable from the government's point of
test2244,i had long pardon on the eve of a by election with threats of a heavy voting deficiency if it were withheld or even delayed would not necessarily be a
test2245,hence the anxiety in the crowded court and in the little groups gathered round the tape machines in white hall and donning street and other affected centres
test2246,the jury returned from considering their verdict there was a flutter an excited murmur a deathlike hush
test2247,the foreman delivered his message
test2248,the jury find a prisoner guilty of blowing up the albert hall
test2249,the jury wished to add a writer drawing attention to the fact that a by election is spending in the parliamentary division of nemesis on hand
test2250,and may the lord have mercy on the pole a junior counsel exclaimed irreverently
test2251,fifteen hundred said the prime minister with a shudder it's too horrible to think of
test2252,our majority last time was only a thousand and seven
test2253,seven thirty admitted the prime minister we must avoid any appearance of precipitancy
test2254,not later than seven thirty den said the chief organizer i have promised the agent down there that he shall be able to display posters announcing plater baph
test2255,he said it was our only chance of getting a telegram red ripper is in to night
test2256,despite the earlyness of the hour a small crowd had gathered in the street outside and the horrible menacing thrall of the fifteen hundred voting men came in
test2257,"he exclaimed, won't go?"
test2258,he says he never has left prison without a breastband to play him out and he is not going to go without one now
test2259,said the prime minister we can hardly be supposed to supply a released prisoner with a brass band how on earth could we defend it on the estimates
test2260,any way you won't go unless he has a pant
test2261,paul opens in five minutes.
test2262,splatter off yet
test2263,in heaven's name why
test2264,the chief organizer rang off
test2265,this is not a moment for standing indignity he observed bluntly musicians must be supplied at once
test2266,can't you get a strike permit as the organizer
test2267,i'll try said the home secretary and went to the telephone
test2268,eight o'clock struck the crowd outside chanted with an increasing volume of sound will vote the other way
test2269,a telegraph brought in
test2270,it was from the central committee rooms at nemesis
test2271,without a band he would not go and they had no band
test2272,a quarter past ten half past
test2273,have you any band instruments of an easy nature to play
test2274,demanded the chief organizer of the prison governor drums symbols those sort of things
test2275,though worders have a private band of their own said the governor but of course i couldn't allow the men themselves
test2276,lend us the instruments said chief organizer
test2277,the popular song of the moment replied the agitator after a moment's reflection
test2278,it was a tune they had all heard hundreds of times so there was no difficulty in turning out a passable imitation of it to it the improvised trains

test2372,nothing but the chimney presented itself
test2373,a happy inspiration had come and placing one hand upon his chest he thrust in the other gave out a tug and drew out his little curved dick glanced
test2374,he divided the paint and produced a few squeaks and grating sounds as he realized that the attempt was madness
test2375,the result was not very satisfactory but sufficient so to make him essay the bar of the window once more producing a era selling sound as he found that now
test2376,but at the end of five minutes he stopped and thrust back the drake into its sheath
test2377,no i can't part with that ha ha laffing the boyers long

test2595,and the third one bruce gordon spotted one of the men who'd been beaten before
test2596,get a stretcher and take him wherever he belongs he ordered
test2597,but the captain stirred finally sighing
test2598,no the cops are giving me we're covered gordon
test2599,but the stern wall gang is backing waine
test2600,but it's going to be tough on them

test2606,no you're a first ter he can't lose
test2607,and then hell is going to pop and this whole planet may be blown wide open
test2608,it fitted with the dae predictions of security and what the spying gordon was going to do according to them
test2609,he was getting even fatter now that he was eating better food from the fair restaurant around the corner
test2610,cost a more but they'd be respectable
test2611,because izzy is always honest according to how he sees it
test2612,but you got earth ideas of the stuff like i had once
test2613,the groups grew more experienced and mardock was training a new squad every night
test2614,it wasn't exactly legal but nothing was here
test2615,this could lead to abusers as he had seen on earth
test2616,but there probably wouldn't be time for it if mayor was re-elected.
test2617,it was night outside and the phosphorescent bulbs at the corners glowed dimly giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the
test2618,it had probably been years since any had dared risk it after the sun went down
test2619,and the slow doubtful respect on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that haley's system was working
test2620,gordon hit the signal switch and the messenger speaker let out a shrill whistle
test2621,gun suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere
test2622,you can't do it to me
test2623,i'm reformed i'm going straight.
test2624,you damned cops can't ollie was blubbering
test2625,one look was enough the work papers had the tell tale over thickening of the signature that had shown up on other papers obviously forgeries

test2635,you owe me some bills governor
test2636,eleven hundred fifty credits
test2637,you didn't pay up your pledge to the captain fund so i had to fill in
test2638,"a thousand interest at ten percent a week standard, right?"
test2639,gordon had heard of the friendly interest charged on the side here but he shook his head wrong as he
test2640,"ha ha, is he turned it over and shook his head"
test2641,now show me where i assigned any agreement saying you pay me back
test2642,for a second izzy's face went blank then he chuckled
test2643,he pulled out the bills and handed them over
test2644,thanks izzy thanks yourself
test2645,the kid pocketed the money cheerfully nodding
test2646,the little guy knew mars as few others did apparently from all sides
test2647,and if any of the other guys had private racks of their own izzy was undoubtedly the man to find it out and use the information with a beat
test2648,the captain looked completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped onto the bench
test2649,go on accept dammit
test2650,there was a man coming from earth on a second ship who would see him
test2651,the little publisher was back at the crusader again

test2703,leslie went to the window and flung it open she put her head out and tried to peer into the darkness but the moon had already set and
test2704,she is a queer erratic creature and that letter there was bad news in that letter
test2705,what can she be doing out by herself?
test2706,lizzy left the room but she had scarcely gone a dozen places down the corridor before she met annie returning
test2707,annie's eyes were very bright her cheeks were no longer pale and there was a brilliant color in them
test2708,she did not take the least notice of lewis but going into the room shut the door

test2723,sincerely citizen's relief
test2724,she turned off the light and lit a candle which she put behind her screen then prepared to get into bed
test2725,annie's manner was very mysterious

test2727,tired out lizzy herself dropped asleep
test2728,annie is that you she called out
