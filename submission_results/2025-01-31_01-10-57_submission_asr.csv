test0000,there's iron they say in all our blood and a grain or two perhaps is good but his he makes me harshly feel has got a little too much of steel anon
test0001,margaret said mister hale as he returned from showing his guests downstairs i could not help watching your face with some anxiety when mister thorne made his confession of having been a shop boy
test0002,you don't mean that you thought me so silly
test0003,i really like that account of himself better than anything else he said
test0004,his statement of having been a shop boy was the thing i like best of all
test0005,you who were always accusing people of being shoppy at hilton.
test0006,i don't think mr. hale you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been
test0007,i really was very much afraid of showing him how much shock i was at some parts of what he said
test0008,his father dying in miserable circumstances
test0009,why it might have been in the workhouse
test0010,his father speculated wildly failed and then killed himself because he could not bear the disgrace
test0011,all his former friends shrunk from the disclosures that had to be made of his dis honest gambling wild hopeless struggles made with other people's money to regain his own moderate portion of wealth
test0012,no one came forward to help the mother and this boy.
test0013,at least no friend came forward immediately and miss thonan is not one i fancy to wait until tardy kindness comes to find her out
test0014,so they litton
test0015,how tautened asked father
test0016,o papa by that testing everything by the standard of wealth
test0017,when he spoke of the mechanical powers he clearly looked upon them only as new ways of extending trade and making money
test0018,and the poor men around him they were poor because they were vicious out of the pale of his sympathies because they had not his inner nature and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich
test0019,not vicious he never said that
test0020,inprovident and self-indulent were his words
test0021,margaret was collecting her mother's working materials and preparing to go to bed
test0022,just as she was leaving the room she hesitated she was inclined to make an acknowledgement which she thought would please her father but which which to be full and true must include a little annoyance
test0023,however out it came
test0024,papa i do think mister thorne a very remarkable man but personally i don't like him at all
test0025,and i do said her father laughing.
test0026,personally as you call it and all
test0027,i don't set him up for a hero or any of that kind
test0028,"but good night, child."
test0029,there were several other signs of something wrong about missus hale.
test0030,she and dixon held mysterious consultations in a bedroom from which dixon would come out crying and cross as was a custom when any distress of her mistress called up on her sympathy
test0031,once margaret had gone into the chamber soon after dixon left it and found her mother on her knees and as margaret stole out she caught a few words which were undoubtedly a prayer for strength
test0032,but though she received cressers and fine words back again in such profusion as would have glad in her formally yet she felt that there was a secret withheld from her and she believed it brought serious
test0033,she lay awake very long this night planning how to lessen the evil influence of the milton life on her mother
test0034,a servant give dixon permanent assistance should be got if she gave up the whole time to the search and then at any rate her mother might have had all the personal attention she required and had been
test0035,visiting register officers seeing all manner of unlikely people and very few in the least likely absorbed margaret's time and thoughts for several days
test0036,one afternoon she met bessie higginson in the street and stopped to speak to her
test0037,"well, bissy, how are you?"
test0038,better and not better if you know what that means
test0039,not exactly replied margaret smiling
test0040,i'm better than not being torn to pieces by coughing night's but i'm wery and tired of milton and longing to get away to the land of bula and when i think
test0041,margaret turned around to walk along alongside of the girl in her weak progress home.
test0042,but for a mineral or two she did not speak
test0043,at last she said in a low voice
test0044,bessy do you wish to die?
test0045,bessie was silent in her turn for a minute or two then she replied
test0046,not worse than many others i reckon.
test0047,but what was it?
test0048,you know i'm a stranger here so perhaps i'm not so quick at understanding what you mean as if i'd lived all my life in milton
test0049,"i had forgotten what i said for the time, continued margaret quietly"
test0050,i should have thought of it again when i was less busy may i go with you now
test0051,the sharpness in her eye turned to a whistling longing as she met margaret soft and friendly gaze
test0052,as they turned up into a small court opening out into a scollared street bessy said
test0053,you'll not be daunted at your fathers at home and speaks a bit gruffy at first.
test0054,it was not at home when they entered.
test0055,gasbey at last.
test0056,bessy took a long and feverous draft and then fell back and shut her eyes
test0057,margaret bent over and said bessy don't be in patience with your life whatever it is or may have been
test0058,remember who gave it to you and made it what it is
test0059,now i'll not have my wench preach to
test0060,but surely said margaret facing round you believe in what i said that god gave her life and ordered what kind of life she was to be
test0061,i believe what i see and no more
test0062,"that's what i believe, young woman."
test0063,i don't believe all i hear no not by big deal
test0064,but who's come at last and who's welcome as long as he'll keep from preaching on what who knows not about
test0065,it's simple and not far to fetch nor hard to work
test0066,but the girl only played the more with margaret.
test0067,don't think hardily on him. he's a good man he is.
test0068,i sometimes think i shall be maked with sorrow even in the city of god your father is not there.
test0069,the feverish color came into her chicks and the feverish flame into her eye
test0070,but you'll be there father you shall oh my heart
test0071,she put her anna to it and became gastly pale
test0072,margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to rest upon her bason
test0073,presently the spasm that anticipated death had passed away and bessy roused herself and said
test0074,i'll go to bed it's best place but catching at margaret's gown you'll come again i know you will but just say it
test0075,"i will come to tomorrow, said margaret."
test0076,margaret went away very sad and thoughtful
test0077,she was late for tea at home
test0078,"have you met with a servant, dear?"
test0079,no mama that ann buckling would never have done.
test0080,"so i try, said mr. hell,"
test0081, everybody else has had their turn at this great difficulty now let me try
test0082,i may be the cinderella to put on the slipper after all
test0083,"what would you do, papa how would you say about it?"
test0084,well i i would apply it to some good house mother to recommend me one known to herself or her servants
test0085,very good but we must first catch our house mother.
test0086,the mother of whom he spoke to us said margaret
test0087,mr. thorne the thorne the only mother he has i believe said mister thorne quietly
test0088,i will like to see her she must be an common person her mother added
test0089, perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us and be glad of our place
test0090,she sounded to be such a careful economic person that i should like any one out of the same family
test0091,"my dear, said mr. hell alarmed, pray don't go off on that idea."
test0092,i'm sure at any rate she would not like strangers to know anything about it.
test0093,take note that this is not my kind of hortinus papalus if i have any at all which i don't agree to you while you're always accusing me of it
test0094,i don't know positively that it is hers either but from little things i have gathered from him i fancy so

test0235,then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his boson and the twain fell down in a fainting feet
test0236,when the unko saw his case he wondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them waited until they should recover
test0237,after a while they came to themselves and usal almanan rejoiced with exceeding joy oppression and depression left her and happiness took the mastery of her and she repeated these verses
test0238,accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the kan and what had happened to her with the badaway how the merchant had bought her of him and had
test0239,but now go to thy master and bring him quickly to me

test0263,what has happened to me
test0264,he asked himself something warm and living quickly to me it must be in the neighborhood

test0327,then the bramman took pity on him and opened the cage door but no sooner had he done so that the tiger jumping out said now i will eat you first and drink the water afterwards
test0328,so the bramman and the tiger walked on until they came to a abandoned tree and the bramman said to it banished tree banished tree here and give judgment
test0329,on what must i give judgment as the abandoned tree
test0330,this tiger said the baman begged me to let him out of this cage to drink a little water and he promised not to hurt me if i did so but now that i have left him out he
test0331,it is just that he should do so or no
test0332,let the tiger eat the man for men are an ungrateful race
test0333,sir camel sir camel cried the bramman hear and give judgment
test0334,at a little distance they have found a bullock lying by the road side
test0335,is it fair that he should do so or not
test0336,let the tiger eat the man for men have no pity
test0337,three out of the six and giving judgment against the bramman but still he did not lose all hope and determined mind to as the other three
test0338,on what must i give judgment asked the evil
test0339,the bramman said the case and the eagle answered whenever men see me they tried to shoot me they climbed the rocks and steal away my little ones
test0340,then the tiger began to roar and said judgment of all is against you or bramman
test0341,after this they saw an allicater and the brama related the matter to him hoping for a more favorable verdict
test0342,but the elephant said when i put my nose out of the water men terrorized me and tried to kill me
test0343,the brahamman gave himself up as lost but again he prayed the tiger to have patience and let him ask the opinion of the sixth judge
test0344,now the sixth was a jackhole
test0345,the braman told his story and said to him uncle jacques uncle jacques say what is your judgment
test0346,show me the pace
test0347,when the got there the jack said now broman show me exactly where you stood
test0348,exactly there was it asked jake
test0349,exactly here replied to bramman
test0350,where was the tiger then
test0351,why i stood so said the tiger jumping into the cage and my head was on this side
test0352,very good said jekoh but i cannot judge without understanding the whole matter exactly
test0353,shut and bolted said the bramman
test0354,then shut and bolted set the jackhole
test0355,when the bramman had had this the jackel said oh you wicked an ungrateful tiger
test0356,when a good bramman opened your door is to eat him the only return you would make
test0357, proceed on your journey friend franman
test0358,your road lies that way and mind this
test0359,and thus accomplished he excited the admiration of every silly quock and the envy of every fluttering come but by all young gentlemen and ladies of understanding he was hardily despised as a mean civil
test0360,that his soul would afterwards occupy such an asstent as would be most suitable to his character it was intense to have the character it was intense to inhabit the body of that finckel grinning
test0361,the moses was afraid and said surely the thing is known

test0364,the egyptian background of the bondage
test0365,everyone who has been discovered has been found by kemner's path the testimony of the oldest biblical narratives regarding the sudden of the hebrews in egypt is also in perfect
test0366,the absence of the detailed reference to the hebrews is therefore perfectly natural
test0367,it seems probable that not all but only part of the tribes which ultimate carolts into the hebrew nation found their way to egypt
test0368,the stories regarding joseph their traditional father ephraim and manasia imply that these strong central tribes perhaps together with the southern tribes of benjamin and juda were the chief actors in
test0369,the biblical narratives apparently disagree regarding the duration of the sudanian in egypt
test0370,the later traditions tend to extend the period
test0371,he were found several inscriptions bearing the egean name of the city patamus house of the god atom
test0372,a contemporary scripts in also states that he found near pittham the house of ramsy's a city with the royal residents and sinpus
test0373,that the hebrews were arrested under this chastity was naturally inevitable
test0374,was any other procedure to be inspected from it the dystanic roar of that land and day
test0375,the making of the loyal patriot
test0376,the story of moses's birth in early childhood is one of the most interesting chapters in biblical history
test0377,which moves it is justified and resisting the english jipps task master
test0378,is pinners always disasters not only to its victims but also to the government imposing it
test0379,nitry he wens in land of midian

test0383,these stand waverers sent him on from trime to trime until he reached the land of kidem each of the dead sea where he remained for a year and a half
test0384,later he found his way to the court of one of the local kings in central palestine where he married and became in the time a prosperous local prince
test0385,the score of the wordiness
test0386,the story of moses is in many ways close to parallel to that sinuette
test0387,the priest the subtribe of the kanits received him into his home and gave him his daughter in marriage
test0388,note the careveristic oriental idea of marriage
test0389,here moses learned the lessons that were essential for his training as a leader and the delivery of his people
test0390,after the capture of jekel certain of them went up with the southern tribes who conquer southern palestine
test0391,many modern scholars draw the conclusion from the biblical narrative that it was from the kinsman that moses first learned of yahweh or as the distinct name of israel's god was translated
test0392,do the arietse sebae traditions imply that the ancestors of the israeli's were worshipers of jehovah
test0393,the title of his funding law implies that this priest ministered at some wilderland sanctuary
test0394,hose's in the home of the indian priest was brought into direct in constant contact with the jehovah worship.
test0395,the cruel fate of his people in the painful experience in egypt that had driven him into the wilderness prepared his mind to receive this training
test0396,his quest was for a jets and strong gun able to deliver the oppressed
test0397,the wildness with its slurking foes and the ever present dread of hunger and thirst deepens his sense of need and of dependence upon the power able to guide the debt's needs of men
test0398,the presence of the vats antonioles plaine of central aminia still will call every life giving spring god has given
test0399,the constant necessity of meeting the dangers of the wildness and the defending the flock in traces to moses care developed his courage in power of leadership in action
test0400,evidently the intention was which made things present for the royal fowl during his visit
test0401,the probsin in the regulative quota as a smoke in the saint's church referred it may make me noted to the act which was held in therein
test0402,sometimes tobacco is used in church for disinfecting or deodorizing purposes
test0403,brankburn art's spits of york who was a great smoker
test0404,on one occasion he was at st. marie's church nashville for a confirmation
test0405,another eighteenth century clerical worthy the famous dr. parar and an eventrate smoker was an accused to do what mister disney prevented arches bits of blackburn from doing he
test0406,par was such a continuous smoker as anyone who came into his company if he had never smoke before and to learn the use of a pipe as a means of self defense
test0407,one sunday says mister ditchfield he had a nether pipe and jason the clerk told him that the people were getting impatience
test0408,"they're singing a other songs, i say, the key."
test0409,they have sir repathty clerk

test0412,david deen haver did not at all improve proved this irreverent
test0413,go to church st haeys in those days must have been a quite in the exciting experience
test0414,when these men in the course of my remonmonstrations found out that was not going to continue the cousin they no longer care to be communication
test0415,parots in that quarter were user destroyed by the sappes is true but the c f for them far more are innocent than are guilty of any acts of violence
test0416,now there after the sun that was the wind fell to in light air that just kept stearman's way on the ship
test0417,fortunately the john was not only fat but she minded her helmet as a light-footed girl turns in a lively dance
test0418,i never was in a better steering sip posey spelty in moderate weather
test0419,mr. marble he had to believe was fairly snipping on the hinkups being like the cells as one might say very asleep
test0420,at that moment i had a noise we were familiar to see men that of an ore falling in the boat
test0421,i say it sell ho in close abroad
test0422,he was too much of a seaman to require a second look in order to a certain what was to be done
test0423,although they went three feet to r two this gave us a moment of breathing time
test0424,as our seats were off off forward and remained so for a few minutes it gave me a leisure to look about
test0425,i soon saw both procs and grading good enough was i to perceive that they had not approached materially near
test0426,mr. kite deserved that so said in remark that our movements had been so prompt as to take the rascal as the back
test0427,a breath for stillness succeeded
test0428,the poets did not attend the course but nearne's fast
test0429,i heard the rattling of the boarding pats to as they were cut a drift from the spankboon and fail upon the decks
test0430,kite went out and returned with three or four muskets and as many pipes
test0431,the stillness that rain on both sides was like that of death.
test0432,the person behaved beautifully he came around like a tuck
test0433,the question was now whether we could pass them or not before they got coming near to grapple
test0434,the captain behaved perfectly well in its critical instance commanding a dead silence in the close its intention to his orders
test0435,now i'm so bored the john was heart.
test0436,on our side we gave the gentlemen the four sixes two at the nears and two at the sternmost prola which was still near a cable length of it in
test0437,they were like the eys of feen in english
test0438,i don't doubt if we touched the man in the nearspire
test0439,that state the ship passes ahead of all her canvas is borne for leaving the proromotivs in her wake
test0440,they swerved up in front of shermon's pailles as thick as they could jam together and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise
test0441,some sung out tear down the fence tear down the fence
test0442,the stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable
test0443,shermon run his eyes slow along the crowd and where it struck the people tried a little to out gaze him but they couldn't they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky
test0444,the average man's is coward.
test0445,because they're afraid the man's friends will shoot them in the back in the dark and it's just what they would do
test0446,so they always acquire and then a man goes in the night with a hundred massed cowards at his back and lence the rascal
test0447,you didn't want to come
test0448,but a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness
test0449,now leave and take your half man with you tossing his gun up through his left arm and kicking it when he says this
test0450,the crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went breaking all apart and went tearing off every which way and buck harkens he healed it after them looking tolerable cheap
test0451,you can't be too careful
test0452,they argued and tried to keep him out but he wouldn't listen and a whole show come to a stand still
test0453,and one or two women began to screen
test0454,so then the ring master he made a little speech and said he hope there wouldn't be no disturbance and if the man would promise he wouldn't make any more trouble he would let him ride if he
test0455,it weren't funny to me though i was all of a tremble to see his danger
test0456,and the horse is going like a house of fire too.
test0457,he shed him so thick they kind of plugged up the air and all together he shed seventeen suits
test0458,why it was one of his own men
test0459,and but never mind the rest of his outfit it was just wild but it was awful funny
test0460,the people most killed themselves laughing and when the king got done capering and capering off behind the scenes they roared and clapped and stormed and hahah until he come back
test0461,twenty people sings out.
test0462,the duke says yes
test0463, everybody sings out sold
test0464,but a big fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts hold on
test0465,just a word gentlemen they stopped to listen
test0466,what we want is to go out of here quiet and talk this show up and sell the rest of the town
test0467,you bet it is the judge is right everybody sings out
test0468,we struck the raft at the same time and in less than two seconds we were gliding down stream all dark and still and edges towards the middle of the river nobody saying a word
test0469,we never showed a light until we was about five miles below the village
test0470,greenhorns flat heads
test0471,no i says it don't
test0472,well it don't because it's in debris i reckon they're all a lot
test0473,well that's what i'm a saying all kings are most rapsgals as far as i can make out is that so
test0474,and look at charles second and leu's fourteen and leu's fifteen and james second and edward second and richard third and forty more besides all those saxen heptarks that
test0475,my you are to seeing old henry the eight when he was in bloom he was a bloom
test0476,ring up fair roseyman.
test0477,well henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country
test0478,suppose he opened his mouth what then
test0479,all i say is kings is kings and you got to make allowances.
test0480,take them all around they're a mighty ornery lock it's the way they're raised
test0481,"well they all do, jim."
test0482,now to duke he's a tolerable like the man in some ways
test0483,this one is a middle and hard lot for a duke.
test0484,when i woke up just a day break he was sitting there with his head up between his knees moaning and morning to himself
test0485,it doesn't seem natural but i think it so
test0486,he was often moaning and mourning at that way nights when he judge i was asleep and saying po little elisabeth
test0487,don't you hear me shut they do.
test0488,i lay i make you mine
test0489,just as loud as i could yell
test0490,which was sound enough judgment but you take the average man and he wouldn't wait for him to how
test0491,the king's duds was all black and he did look real swell and starchy.
test0492,why before he looked like the ordinary old rip that ever was but now when he would take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile he looked that grand and good and p
test0493,jim cleaned up the canoe and i got my paddle ready.
test0494,where are you bound for young man?
test0495,"get away, says the king."
test0496,i did so and then we all three started on again.
test0497,the young chap was mighty thankful said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather.
test0498,he asked the king who he was going and the king told him we'd come down the river and landed at the other village this morning and now he was going up a few miles to see an old
test0499,but then i say again no i reckon it ain't him or else he wouldn't be walking up the river you aren't him are you?
test0500,no my name is blodging alexander blodging reverend alexander blodging i suppose i must say is i'm one of the large poor servants
test0501,you see he was pretty old and george's geller was too young to be much company for him except mary jane the redheaded one and so he was kind of lonely after george and
test0502,too bad too bad he couldn't have lived to see his brother's poor soul
test0503,i'm going in a ship next wendy forry jeroine where my uncle is
test0504,but it will be lovely wished i was going
test0505,mary jane's nineteen susanne is about fourteen and jana is about fourteen that's the one that gives herself to good works and has a hair lip poor things
test0506,well they could be worse off.
test0507,o peter had friends and they aren't going to let them come to no harm.
test0508,blame if he didn't acquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town and all about the wilses and about peter's business which was a tanner and about george's which was a
test0509,when they're deep they won't stop for a hell.
test0510,was peter wilks well off?
test0511,when we struck the boat she was about done loading and pretty soon she got off
test0512,now hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the new carpet bags.
test0513,so then they waited for a steam boat.
test0514,that the king was calm he says
test0515,they give a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to say would they tell you
test0516,then one of them says kind of soft and gentle
test0517,felps was one of these little one horse cotton plantations and they all look like
test0518,i went around and climb over the back style by the ashperper and started for the kitchen
test0519,i out with a yes for i thought
test0520,so then she started for the house leading me by the hand and the children tagging after
test0521,when we got there she set me down in a split bottom chair and set herself down on a little little stool in front of me holding both of my hands and says
test0522,well it's lucky because sometimes people do get hurt
test0523,and i think he died afterwards he was a baptist
test0524,yes it was mortification. that was it.
test0525,your uncle's been up to the town every day to fetch you
test0526,you must have met him on the road didn't you old man with a
test0527,"why child, it'll be stolen."
test0528,it was kind of thin ice but i says
test0529,i had my mind on the children all the time i wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little and find out who i was
test0530,pretty soon she made the cold chill strike all down my back because she says
test0531,i see it wasn't a bit of use to try to go ahead i'd got to throw up my hand
test0532,so i says to myself here is another place where i got to rest the truth
test0533,i opened my mouth to begin but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed and says here it comes
test0534,children don't you say a word
test0535,i see i was in a fix now
test0536,"missus felp, she jumped for him and says"
test0537,has he come no says his wife
test0538,i can't imagine says the old man and i must say it makes me dreadful un easy
test0539,un easy she says i'm ready to go distracted
test0540,he must have come and you've missed him along the road.
test0541,"oh, don't distress me any more and i'm already distressed."
test0542,why silis look yander up the road isn't that somebody coming
test0543,the old gentleman stared and says
test0544,i ain't any idea who is it
test0545,it's tom sayer
test0546,being tom sorey was easy and comfortable and it stayed easy and comfortable until by and by i hear a seaboat coughing along down the river
test0547,then i says to myself suppose time sora comes down on that boat
test0548,but i am greatly pleased that you have seen my lady
test0549,i knew you could not choose but like her but yet let me tell you you have seen but the worst of her
test0550,her conversation has more charms than can be in mere beauty and a humor and disposition would make a deformation person appear lovely
test0551,why did you not send me that news and a gallon
test0552,well the best on it is that i have a quire now that is as good as a night
test0553,in honest we have had such a scamper and upon so foolish an occasion as i can not tell which is strange
test0554,all the people that i had ever in my life refused were brought again upon the stage like richard's third ghosts to repent with me and all the kindness his discoveries could make i had for you was
test0555,my best qualities if i have any that are good served but for aggregations of my fault and i was allowed to have wit and understanding and discretion in other things that it might appear i had none in
test0556,it is a strange change and i'm very sorry for it but i'm very sorry for it but i say i know not how to help it
test0557,mr. fish is a squire of dane's and has so many mistress's that anyone may pretend to share in him and be believed but though i have the honor to be his near neighbor to
test0558,i think my younger brother comes down with him
test0559,i can no sooner give you some little hints whereabout they live but you know them presently and i meant you should be beholding to me for your acquaintance
test0560,but it seems this gentleman is not so easy access but you may acknowledge something due to me if i incline him to look graciously upon you and therefore there is not much harm done
test0561,i have missed four fits and i have had but had four five and have recovered so much strength as made me ventured to meet your letter on wednesday a mile from home
test0562,but besides i can give you others.
test0563,i am here much more out of people's way than in town where my aunt and such as pretend and interest in me and a power over me do so persecute me with their dear good nature and
test0564,you will think him altered and if it would be possible more melancholy than he was
test0565,if marriage agrees no better with other people than it does with him i shall pray that all my friends may escape
test0566,well in honest if i was a prince that lady should be my mistress but i can give no rule to anyone else and perhaps those that are in no danger of losing their hearts to her may be infinite
test0567,the matter is not great for i confess i do naturally hate the noise and talk of the world and should be best pleased never to be known in it upon any occasion whatever since it can never be hol
test0568,if i had a picture that would fit for you you should have it
test0569,how can you talk of defying fortune nobody lives without it and therefore why should you imagine you could
test0570,i know not how my brother comes to be so well informed as you say but i am sure he knows yeast most of the injuries you have received from her
test0571,we have had another debate but much more calmly
test0572,and besides there was a time when we ourselves were indifferent to one another did i do so then or have i learned it since
test0573,i have been studying how tomcheek might come by his intelligence and i very believe he has it from my cousin peters
test0574,how kindly do i take the civilities of your fathers in earnest you cannot imagine how his letter pleased me
test0575,would it would leave me and then i could believe i shall not have occasion for it
test0576,my poor lady vavasa is carried to the tower and her great belly was not excuse her because she was acquainted by somebody that there was a plot against the protector and did not discover it
test0577,she has told now all that was told her but vows she will never say from whom she had it we shall see whether her resolutions are as unalterable as those of my lady tamish
test0578,i wonder how she behaved herself when she was married.
test0579,i never saw any one yet that did not look simply and out of countenances never knew a wedding well designed but one and that was of two people who were at time enough i confessed to contr
test0580,the truth is i could not endure to be missus bride in a public wedding to be made the happiest person on earth
test0581,do not take it ill for i would endure it if i could rather than fail but in earnest i do not think it were possible for me
test0582,yet in honest your father will not find my brother paten wanting in civility though he is not a man of much compliment unless it be in his letters to me nor an unreasonable person in anything so
test0583,my aunt told me no longer gone than yesterday that i was the most willful woman that she ever knew and had an ostentation of spirit nothing could overcome take head
test0584,you see i give you fair warning
test0585,by the next i shall be gone to kent and my other journeys laid aside which i am not pleased at because it would have broken our course very much
test0586,here are some verses of callees tell you how you like them
test0587,i told you in my last that my suffled journey was laid aside and that into kent hasten
test0588,if i drown by the way this will be my last letter and like a will i be i bequeath all my kindness to you in it with a charge never to bost it all upon another
test0589,indeed i like him extremely and he is commanded to me by people who know him very well and are able to judge for a most excellent servant and faithful as possible
test0590,because you find fault with my other letters this is like to be shorter than them i did not intended so but i can show you
test0591,i do not find it though i am told i am so extremely when i believe you love me
test0592,but i am called upon
test0593,directed for your master
test0594,i see you can chid when you please and with authority but i deserve it i confess and all i can say for myself is that my fault proceeded from a very good principle in me
test0595,we dare not let our tongues lie more on one side of our masts than the other for fear of overturning it
test0596,you are satisfied i hope if this that i escaped drowning
test0597,but i am troubled much you should make so ill a journey to so little purpose indeed i read by the first post after my arrival here and cannot imagine how you came to miss of my letters
test0598,how welcome you will be but alas
test0599,for my life i can not beat into their heads a passion that must be subject to no decay an even perfect kindness that must last permanently without the least interruption
test0600,they laughed to hear me say that one unkind word would destroy all the satisfaction of my life and that i should expect our kindness should increase every day if it was possible but never lesson
test0601,we go abroad all day and play all night and say our prayers when we have time
test0602,well in sober earnest now i would not live as a twelve months to gain all that the king has lost unless it was to give it him again
test0603,will you be so good natured?
test0604,he has one son and it's the finest boy that ever you saw and has a noble spirit but but stands in the awe of his father that one word from him is as much as twenty whips
test0605,you must give me leave to entertain you with discussions of the family for i can tell you nothing else from hence
test0606,not to know when you would come home i can assure you nor for any other occasion of my own but with a cousin of mine that had long developed to make herself sport with him and did not miss
test0607,in my life i never heard so ridiculous a discourse as he made us and no old woman who passes for a witch could have been more puzzled to seek what to say to reasonable people than he was
test0608,ever since this adventure i have had so great a belief in all things with this nature that i could not forbear laying a pees cord with nine pees inches under my door yesterday and was informed
test0609,she pulled her hair down turned her skirt back put her feet on the fender and took putter into her lap all of which arrangements meant that something very important had got to be thought over and settled
test0610,the more proposals the more credit
test0611,i've tried it and liked it and maybe this is the consequence of that night's fun.
test0612,just suppose it is true that he does ask me and i say yes
test0613,what a sorry thing i am?
test0614,i could do so much for all at home how i should enjoy that
test0615,let me see how can i begin
test0616,he has known her all her life and has a good influence over her.
test0617,now as polly was by no means a perfect creature i am free to confess that the old terror assaulted her more than once that week for when the first excitement of the dashing reform had sub
test0618,i don't think it was his wealth accomplishments or position that most attracted polly though these doubtless possessed a greater influence than she suspected
test0619,it was that indescriable something which women are quick to see and feel in men who have been blessed with wise and good mothers
test0620,this had an special charm to polly for she soon found that this side of her character was not shown to everyone.
test0621,lately this had changed especially towards polly and it flitted her more than she would confess even to herself.
test0622,at first she tried to think she could but unfortunately heart's are so contrary that they won't be able to reason will or even credibility
test0623,polly felt a very courteous friendship for mr. sydney but not one particle of the love which is the only coin in which love can be truly paid
test0624,this finished polly's decision and after that night she never allowed herself to develop upon the pleasant temptation which came in a gaze particularly attractive to a young girl with the spies of the old eve
test0625,when saturday came polly started as usual for visit to becky and bees but could not resist stopping at the shores to leave a little parcel for fan though it was calling time
test0626,a foolish little speech to make to a dark but you see polly was only a tenderhearted girl trying to do her duty.
test0627,take hold of master charles's miss. maey and look beautiful like willy and flassy said the maid.
test0628,at a street corner a black-eyed school boy was parting from a rosy face school girl whose music role he was reluctantly surrendering.
test0629,how he got there was never very clear to poly but there he was flushed and a little out of breath but looking so glad to see her till she had not the heart to be stiff and cool
test0630,she really could not help it it was so pleasant to see him again just when she was feeling so lonely
test0631,"that is the way i get to the rush, said polly."
test0632,she did not mean to tell but his fairness was so agreeable she forgot herself.
test0633,but i know her better and i assure you that she does improve she tries to mean her thoughts though she won't own it and will surprise you some day by the amount of heart and sense and good
test0634,"thank you, no."
test0635,how lovely the park looks she said in great confusion.
test0636,as the art for young man laying a trap into which polly immediately fell.
test0637,he was quicker to take a hint than he had expected and being both proud and generous wise off to settle the matter at once for poly's sake as well as his own
test0638,so when she made her last brilliant remark he said quietly watching her face keenly all the while i thought so well i'm going out of town on business for several weeks so you can enjoy your little
test0639,she thought she had a good deal of the coquette in her and i have no doubt that with time and draining she would have been a very dangerous little person but now she was far too transparent
test0640,he was gone before she could do anything but look up at him with a remorseful face and she walked on feeling that the first and perhaps the only woman she would ever have had had his answer and
test0641,polly did not return to her favorite walk until she learned from mini that uncle had really left town and then she found that his friendly company and conversation was what had made the way so pleasant after all
test0642,working two and four as usual what's the news with you?
test0643, perhaps shield he told him.
test0644,uterally done with and lay upon the shelf.
test0645,mini said the other day she wished she was a pigeon so she could paddle in the pits and not fuss with rappers
test0646,"now don't be affected, polly but just tell me like a deer has not he proposed."
test0647,don't you think he means to?
test0648,truly jule jule fan.
test0649,i don't mean to being praying but i really thought he did.
test0650,well i always meant to try if i got a chance and i have
test0651,i just gave him a hint and he took it.
test0652,he meant to go away before that so don't think his heart is broken or mind what teddlers say
test0653,he understood and being a gentleman made no fuss.
test0654,but polly it would have been a great great thing for you.
test0655,i'm odd you know i prefer to be an independent spinster and teach music all my days.
test0656,never mind what the business was it surfaces as to say that it was a good beginning for a young man like tom who have been born and bred in the most conservative class of the most conceded
test0657,fortunately every one was so busy with the necessary preparations that there was no time for romans of any sort and the four young people worked together as soberly and sensibly as if all sorts of emotions
test0658,pity that the end will come so soon but the hour did its work and went its way leaving a clearer atmosphere behind but the young folks did not see it then for their eyes were dim because of
test0659,if it had not been for two things i fear she never never would have stood a summer in town but sydney often called to her vacation came and the voluminous correspondence with polly begeg
test0660,tum wrote once a week to his mother the letters were short and not very satisfied for men never do tell the interesting little things that women best like to hear
test0661,now i'm only tired had a good good thing to do recently and the weather makes me just a travel broo.
test0662,"forget me, polly, but i can't help saying it for it is there and i want to be as true to you as you were to me if i can."
test0663,i tried to deceive myself but it seems as if there was a chance of happiness for me.
test0664,"thank heaven for that,"
test0665,goldy with the hardiest satisfaction in her voice.
test0666,poor poly was so taken by surprise that she had not a word to say.
test0667,no when needed she told her face entered for her as well as the impulse which made her hide her head in the sofa cushion like a foolish ostrich when the hands are after it
test0668,once or twice but sort of chuckling and i thought it was only some little flapping.
test0669,it was so silly of me not to guess before.
test0670,it was so tender honest and defiant that fanny forgot the defense of her own love and admiration of polly loyalty to her for this faithful all absorbing love was a new revelation of fanny who
test0671,"i hope maria baley's only things her, she added softly, for i could not bear to have him disappointed again."
test0672,said fanny turning hopeful all at once.
test0673,"suppose i say a word to tum just ask question after his heart and a channel away, you know and give him a chance to tell me if there's anything to tell."
test0674,"bear it people always do bear things somehow, and said polly, looking as if sentence had been passed upon her."
test0675,it was a very different window from the last for both the girls.
test0676,if anyone wanted to show him what she could do towards making a pleasant home she certainly succeeded by than she suspected for in spite of many failures and discouragement behind the scenes the little house became a most
test0677,she kept much at home when the day's work was done finding it pleasant to sit dreaming of a book or or alone than to excite herself even to go to the shores.
test0678,polly was not at all like herself that window and those nearest to her saw and waded at most.
test0679,for net was so absorbed in business that he ignored the whole baley question and left them in other darkness.
test0680,then he came walking upon her one day looking as if she poor held of such great joy that she hardly knew how to tell them.
test0681,but if work baskets were gifted with powers of speech they could tell stories more true and tender than any we read.
test0682,she had even been in society before the revolution
test0683,it was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names on every pretext
test0684,every year she solumly renewed her vows and at the moment of taking the oath she said to the priest monsieur s. francesse gave it to to monsieur s. fr
test0685,and the school girls would begin to laugh not in their sleeves but under their bales charming little fished laughs which made the vocal mother's frown
test0686,it was a century which spoke through her but it was the eighteen century
test0687,the rule of fenton valter did not forbid this
test0688,she would not show the object to anyone.
test0689,thus it furnished a subject of comment for all those who were on occupied or board in the convent
test0690,some unique chaps some authentic relic
test0691,they lost themselves in conjectures
test0692,when the poor old woman died they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting perhaps and opened it
test0693,he is resisting fluttering his tiny wings and still making an effort to fly but the dancers laughing with a satanic air
test0694,moral love conquered by the collag.
test0695,the priscus returned and seated herself once more on her chair
test0696,we will present a stenographic report of the dialogue which then ensued to the best of our ability
test0697,father forvent
test0698,reverent mother do you know the chapel
test0699,and you have been in the choir and pursuit of your duties two or three times
test0700,there is a stone to be raised heavy
test0701,the slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar
test0702,the slab which closes the vault yes
test0703,it would be a good thing to have two men for it
test0704,a woman is never a man
test0705,because dom marmaline gives four hundred and seventeen epes of stenton's hortus only gives three hundred and sixty seven i do not despise marmelone's horses neither
test0706, marriage consists in working according to one's strength a cloak is not a dockyard
test0707,and a woman is not a man but my brother is a strong one though
test0708,and can you get a getter?
test0709,there is a ring in the stone.
test0710,i will put the lever through it
test0711,that is good reverent mother i will open the vault
test0712,will that be all no?
test0713,"give me your orders, very reverent mother"
test0714,for that we have confidence in you
test0715,i'm here to do anything you wish.
test0716,and to hold your piece about everything yes rev. mother
test0717,where the-valvet is open i will close it again
test0718,but before that what reverent mother
test0719,father father mother
test0720,you know that my mother died this morning
test0721,no did you not hear the bell?
test0722,nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden really
test0723,and then the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning
test0724,it was mother crucifixion
test0725,three years ago madam de beppon a jansson turned orthodox merely from having mother's resurrection at prayer ah
test0726,the mothers have taken her to the bedroom which opens on the church i know
test0727,a fine sight it would be to see a man in the bedroom more often
test0728,hey more often
test0729,what do you say?
test0730,i say more often more often than what
test0731,reverent mother i did not say more often than what i said more often
test0732,but i did not say more often
test0733,at that moment nine o'clock struck
test0734,at nine o'clock in the morning and at all hours prayed and adored to be the most holy sacrament of the altar said the prisa
test0735,it cut more often short
test0736,forshavl mopped his head.
test0737,in her life time mother crucification made converts after her death she will perform miracles she will
test0738,fatherly vent the community has been blessed in mother's resurrection
test0739,she retained her consciousness to the very last moment
test0740,she gave us her last commands
test0741,if you had a little more faith and if you could have been in her cell she would have cured her leg merely by touching it she smiled
test0742,there was something of paradise in that death
test0743,folleslavot thought that it was an orsoni which she was finishing
test0744,forswalt held his piece she went on
test0745,i have consulted upon this point many eclesiastics laboring in our lord who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life and who bear wonderful fruit
test0746,fortunately the prisris completely absorbed in her own thoughts did not hear it.
test0747,she continued further prevent
test0748,yes reverent mother
test0749,"tartrencis bishop of port, where the mouth of the tiber empties into the sea requested that on his tomb might be engraved the sign which was placed on the graves of paras"
test0750,the dead must be obey so be it
test0751,"for that matter, no mother, mother."
test0752,the father of vent mother crucification will be entered in the coffin in which she has slept for the last twenty years that is just
test0753,it is a continuation of her slumber
test0754,so i shall have to nail up that coffin yes
test0755,i am at the orders of the very reverent community
test0756,the four mother presenters will assist you
test0757,no in lowering the coffin
test0758,where in the vault
test0759,folshuva started the vault under the altar
test0760,under the altar but
test0761,you will have an iron bar yes but
test0762,you will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring but
test0763,the dead must be obeyed to be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel not to go to prophetic earth to remain in there in death where she prayed while living such was the
test0764,she asked it of us that is to say commanded us
test0765,but it is forbidden
test0766,oh i am a stone in your walls
test0767,think father venn if she were to work miracles here
test0768,what a glory of god for the community and miracles issue from tombs
test0769,but reverent mother is the agent of the sanitary commission
test0770,but the commission of police
test0771,shoan dammer one of the seven german kings who entered among the gals under the empire of consantine expressively recognized the right of nuns to be married in religion that is
test0772,the world is nothing in the presence of the cross.
test0773,martin the eleventh general of the carthurians gave to his order this device stata crew doom volvur orbus
test0774,"the prisa, who is usually subject to the barrier of silence and whose reservoir was over full rose and exclaimed with the lucality of a dam which has broken broken"
test0775,i have on my right bennon and on my left bernard who was bernard
test0776,the first abab of clarevaar
test0777,his order has produced forty pope's two hundred cardinals fifty patriarches sixteen hundred archbishops four thousand and six hundred bishops four thousand and six hundred bishops four thousand and six hundred bishops four thousand
test0778,on one side saint bernard on the other the agent of the sanitary department
test0779,god subverted to the commission of police such as the age silence forvav.
test0780,no doubt the right of the monastery to seppelter.
test0781,only fanatics and those in error deny it.
test0782,we live in times of terrible confusion
test0783,we are ignorant and imps.
test0784,and then religion is attacked why?
test0785,because there have been bad priests because sagatara bishop of gap was a brother of solanio bishop of emberman and because both of them followed mama all
test0786,they persecuted the saints.
test0787,they shut their eyes to the truth darkness is the rule
test0788,the most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind
test0789,oh how wicked people are
test0790,by order of the king signifies today by order of the revolution
test0791,one no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead a holy death is prohibited
test0792,"gutterie, bishop of chellon held his own in this matter against otho, duke of burgundy."
test0793,the priser took breath then turned to foshal
test0794,you will close the coffin the sisters will carry it to the chapel.
test0795,the office for the dead will then be set.
test0796,but she will hear she will not listen
test0797,besides what the closeknows the world learns not
test0798,a pause in suit.
test0799,you will remove your bell.
test0800,has the doctor for the dead paid his visit?
test0801,he will pay at four o'clock today.
test0802,the peel which orders the doctor for the death to be summoned has already been wrong.
test0803,but you do not understand any of the peels
test0804,"that is well, father prevent"
test0805,where will you obtain it?
test0806,i have my heap of old iron at the bottom of the garden
test0807,reverent mother what?
test0808,if you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort my brother is the strong man for you a perfect turk
test0809,you will do it as quickly as possible
test0810,i cannot be very fast i'm firm that is why i require an assistant i limp
test0811,everything must have been completed a good quarter of an hour before that
test0812,i will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community these are my orders i am to nail the coffin
test0813,at eleven o'clock exactly i am to be in the chapel
test0814,parentity will be there two men would be better
test0815,however nevermind i shall have my lover
test0816,after which there will be no trace of anything
test0817,the government will have no suspicion.
test0818,the empty coffin remains this produced a pass
test0819,what is to be done with that coffin father.
test0820,it will be given to the earth empty
test0821,"ah, leader excluded, fashal."
test0822,the ville stuck fast in his throat
test0823,he made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath
test0824,"i will put earth on the coffin, rev. mother that will produce the effect of a corpse"
test0825,i will make that my special business
test0826,"general observations on preservers, confectionery, ices and dessert dishes."
test0827,the expense of preserving them with sugar is a serious objection for except a sugar is used in considerable qualities the success is very uncertain
test0828,fruit gathered in wet or foggy weather will soon be melded and be of no service for preserves
test0829,but to distinguish these properly requires very great attention and considerable experience
test0830,if you dip the finger into the serve and apply to the thumb the intensity of the serve will on separating the finger and thumb afford a thread which soon breaks this is the little thread
test0831,let it boil up again and then take it off and remove carefully the scum that has risen
test0832,it is considered to be sufficiently boiled when some taken up in a spoon pours out like oil
test0833,before sugar was in use honey was employed to preserve many vegetable productions though this substance is now given by the juice of the sugar cane
test0834,fourteen ninety nine
test0835,boil them up three days successfully skimming each time and they will then be finished and in a state fit to be put into pots for use.
test0836,the reason why the fruit is empty out of the preserving pan into an earthpan is that the acid of the fruit acts upon the copper of which the preserving pans are usually made
test0837,from this example the process of preserving fruits from sugar would be easily understood
test0838,they should be dried in the stove or oven on a seve and turned every six or eight hours fresh powdered sugar being sifted over them every time they are turned
test0839,in this way it is also that orange and lemon chips are preserved
test0840,marmalade's jams and fruit paste are of the same nature and are now in very general quest
test0841,marmets and jams differ little from each other their preserves of half liquid consistency made by boiling the pulp of fruits and sometimes part of the rines with sugar
test0842,that they may keep it is necessary not to be sparing of sugar fifteen o three
test0843,in all the operations for preserve making when the preservation pan is used it should not be placed on the fire but on a tribet unless the jam is made on a hot plate when this is not
test0844,confectionary fifteen o eight
test0845,"in speaking of confectionary should be mentioned that all the various preparations above named come strictly speaking under that head for the various fruits, flowers, herbs and juices which when boiled with sugar were formally employed"
test0846,the thousand and one ornamented dishes that adorned the tables of the wealthy should be purchased from the confectioner they can not profitably be made at home
test0847,however as late as the rain of our two last georgia's fantastic sums were often expended upon fanciful desserts
test0848,the shape of the dishes varies at different periods the prevailing fashion at present being oval and circular dishes on stems
test0849,iesis.
test0850,at desserts or at some evening parties ices are scarce to be dispersed with
test0851,the spatel is generally made of copper kept bright and clean
test0852,they should be taken immediately after they were past or some hours after because the taking of these substances during the process of digesting is apt to provoke in displacement
test0853,there was once on the time a widow who had a son and a daughter by his first wife.
test0854,from the very day that the new wife came into the house there was no peace for the men's children and not a corner to be found where he could get any rest so the boy thought that the
test0855,but his sister who was still at home fared worse and worse
test0856,kiss me girl said the head
test0857,when the king entered in saw he stood still as if he were in feters and could not stir from the spot for the picture seen to him so beautiful
test0858,the youth promised to make all the hasty he could and set forth from the king's palace
test0859,at last they came inside of land
test0860,well if my brother says so i must do it said the man's daughter and she flung her casket into the sea
test0861,what is my brother saying? asked his sister again
test0862,on the first sunday night after this a beautiful maiden came into the kitchen of the palace and asked the kitchen maid who slept there to let her brush
test0863,she begged very prittily and got it and then she brushed her hair and the gold dropped from it
test0864,out on the ugly bushy bride sleeping so soft by the young king's side on sand and stones my bed i make and my brother sleeps with a cold snake un pitying and unwept
test0865,i will come twice more and then never again said she
test0866,this time also as before she borrowed a brush and brushed her hair with it and the gold dropped down as she did it and again she sent the dog out three times and when day dawned she departed
test0867,no one can tell how delighted the king was to get rid of that hated bushy bride and get a queen who was bright and beautiful his day itself.
test0868,willdet serve me and watch my seven fowls as the king.
test0869,the youth thought that it was very easy work to watch the foles and that he could do it well enough.
test0870,hast thou watched faithfully and well the whole day long said the king when the lad came into his presence in the evening
test0871,"yes that i have said, said the youth."
test0872,he had gone out once to seek a place he said but never would he do such a thing again.
test0873,then the king promised him the same punishment and the same reward that he had promised his brother
test0874,when he had run after the fols for a long long time and was hot and tired he passed by a clef in the rock where an old woman was sitting spinning with the distif and
test0875,"you come here hither, my handsome son, and let me comb your hair."
test0876,the youth like the thought of this let the holes run where they chose and seated himself in the celt of the rock by the side of the old hag
test0877,so there he sat with his head on her lap taking his ease the live long day
test0878,"on the third day, siddia wanted to set out."
test0879,the two brothers laughed at him and his father and mother asked him not to go to him but all to no purpose and cinderlads went out on his way
test0880,i'm walking about in search of a place at cinderlaad
test0881,i would much rather have the princess at cinderlaad
test0882,and so they journeyed down towards a long long way.
test0883,when they had gone us for a long long way the full again asked do you see anything now
test0884,"yes, now i see something that is white said cindal."
test0885,it looks like a chunk of a great thick bark tree.
test0886,cinda had tried but could not do it so he had to take a draw from the pitcher and then one more and after that still another and then he was able to wheel the sword with perfect ease
test0887,for we are brothers of the princess whom you are to have when now you tell the king what we even drink but there's a mighty troll who has cast a spell over us
test0888,when they had traveled a long long way the full said does do not see anything
test0889,"and now inquieted, says she's still nothing now."
test0890,now then said the four does do not see anything now
test0891,that is a river said the full and we have to cross it
test0892,"i've done my best answer, cinderlaad."
test0893,one upon a time there was a king in the north who had won a wars but now he was old.
test0894,the old king went out and fought bravely but at last his sword broke and he was wounded and his men fled
test0895,but in the night when the battle was over his young wife came out and searched for him among the slain and at last she found him and asked whether he might be healed
test0896,so you the queen how do you know in the dark of night whether the hours are wearing to the morning and she said
test0897,then the old man said drive all the horses into the river and choose the one that swims across
test0898,he is no bigger than other dragons said the tutor and if you were brave as your father you would not fear him
test0899,then the person who had killed otter went down and caught the dragon who owned all the treasure and took it from him
test0900,only one ring was left which the dwarf war and even that was taken from him
test0901,so regean made a sword and siger tried it with a blow on a lump of iron and the sword broke
test0902,then siger went to his mother and asked for the broken pieces of his father's blade and gave them to regin
test0903,so she said that sword would do.
test0904,then he saw the track which the dragon had made when he went to a cliff to drink and the track was as if a great river had rolled along and left a deep valley
test0905,but sager waited until half of him had crawled over the pit and then he thrust the sword graham right into his very heart
test0906,sider said i would touch none of it if by losing it i should never die
test0907,but all men die and no brave man lets death frighten him from his desire
test0908,thy vavfahf and then vavfahd died
test0909,then siger rode back and met regean and regean asked him to roast favner's heart and let him taste of it
test0910,so she put the heart of faffon on a steak and roasted it.
test0911,there's siger roasting faggin's heart for another when he should taste of it himself and learn all wisdom.
test0912,that let him do then right over hinnel to the place where brunhild's sleepings.
test0913,there must she sleep till thou comes for her waking rise up and ride for now sure she will swear the vow fearful of breaking
test0914,then he took the helmet off the head of the sleeper and behold she was a most beautiful lady
test0915,then ridged away and he came to the house of a king who had a fair daughter
test0916,linbergh's father told gunner that she would marry none but him who could ride the flame in front of her enchanted tower and then he rode and gunner said his horse was at the
test0917,for one day when brenner and gundner were bathing brenner waited farthest out into the river and said she did that to show she was gundner superior
test0918,for her husband she said had ridden through the flame when no other man dared face it
test0919,not long to wait he said until the bitter sword stands fast in my heart and now will not live long when i am dead
test0920,lobsters and lobsters.
test0921,when is a lobster not a lobster when it is a crayfish
test0922,this question and answer might well go into the primary of information for those who come to san francisco from the east for what is called a lobster in san francisco is not a lobster at all but a
test0923,the pacific crabfish however serves every purpose and while many contend that its meat is not so delicate in flavor as that of its eastern cousin the california will always be allowed for the patriotism of the
test0924,a book could be written about this restaurant and that all would not be told for all its secrets can never be known
test0925,it was here that most amazing dinner's were arranged it was here that extraordinary dishes were conducted by chefs with worldwide fame it was here that lobster alen newbury reached its highest perfection and this is the
test0926,lobster ellyne newberg
test0927,a pound of lobster meat one tablespoon of butter one half pint of cream yolk's four eggs one glass of cream yolk's lobster fat
test0928,"put this in a double boiler and let cook until thick, stirring constantly."
test0929,serve in a chafing dish with thin slices of dry toast
test0930,king of shellfish
test0931,one has to come to san francisco to participate of the king of shellfish the mammoth pacific crab.
test0932,i say come to san francisco adviseably for while the crab is found all along the coast it is prepared nowhere so deliciously as in san francisco.
test0933,gobies passed with the fire and the little restaurant bearing his name and in charge of his wife in union square avenue has not attained the fame of the old place
test0934,it is possible that she knows the secret of preparing crab as it was prepared in the gobies of before the fire but his reputation had not descend to her
test0935,gobies crab stew
test0936,take the meat of one large crab scrap out all the fat from the shell
test0937,soke the crab meat in the chare two hours before cooking

test1268,it was an extremely difficult task and i was anxious to observe all the niceness of art which i had learned so was not to lapse into some error

test1272,then i thanked him and said i had no greater desire than to show those envious people that i had it in me to execute the promised work.
test1273,i had better look to my conduct for it had come to his ears that i relied on his favor to take in first one man and another.
test1274,i begged his most illustrious excellence to name a single person who i had ever taken in

test1283,now i hope to show them that i am a old sculptor if god will grant me the bown of finishing my perseus for that noble piazza of his most impressive excellence
test1284,having this excellent resolve in heart i reached my home
test1285,walders was rather serry after the ladies had flown away from the scene and he drank his liquor doggedly
test1286,it was his fantasy i suppose to revive certain certain emotional relationships which had it may be once existed between him and miss lake and he was a person of that combative temperament that magnifies an object in
test1287,the story of fridlin and wretched's pretty outlines.
test1288,sit down beside me and i'll tell you the story.
test1289,he assisted at it but took no part and in fact was listening to that other conversation which sounded with its pleasant gabble in laughter like a little musical tinkle of bells in the distance
test1290,but honest mark forgot that young ladies do not always come out quite quite and jump unassisted into their vehicles.
test1291,but the middle sun was little in lora he was neither dark nor fair he was neither handsome or strong.
test1292,throwing himself on his knees before the king he cried oh royal sire baste upon me also a sword in and in a deed that i may up and away to follow my brother
test1293,"but the king laughed him to scorn thou, a sword, he said,"
test1294,inthou shalt have one but it shall be one befitting thy maiden size and courage so it is small a weapon can be found in all my kingdom
test1295,fourthforth with the grinning gesture began shriking with laughter so that the bells by his mottled cap were all set of jingling
test1296,i did but laughed to think that the sword of elreid had been so quickly found responded the gesture and he pointed to the scissors hanging from the taylor's girdle
test1297,one night as he lay in a deep forest too unhappy to sleep he heard a noise near him in the bushes
test1298,"you shall shall have your freedom, he cried even though you shall should run me and peace in the moment you aren't free."
test1299,it had suddenly disappeared and in its place stood a beautiful fairy with filmy wings with shone like roses in the moonlight.
test1300,at this moment there was a distant rumbling as of thunder tis the ogre cried the fairy we must hasten
test1301,cissors grow a giant's height and save us from the ogre's might.
test1302,he could see the ogre standing powerless to hurt him on the other side of the cask and nashing his teeth each one of which was as big as a millstone
test1303,the sight was so terrible that he turned on his heel and fled away as fast as his feet could carry him
test1304,"you shall not be left a prisoner in this stigmatic spot while i have the power to help you,"
test1305,he lifted the scissors and with one stroke destroyed the web and gave the fly's life.
test1306,a faint glimmer of light on the opposite wall shows me the key hole.
test1307,the prince spent all the following time until midnight trying to think of a suitable verse to say to the scissors
test1308,as he uttered the words the scissors leaped down of his hand and began to cut through the wooden shudders as easily as through through his cheese
test1309,in a very short time the prints and crawled through the opening.
test1310,while he stood looking around him in bewilderment a firefly lighted on his hand flashing its little lantern in the prince's face it cried this way my friend the fly sent me to guide you
test1311,what has to become of me? cried the poor peasant.
test1312,my grain must fall and rot in the field from over ripeness because i have not the strength to rise and harvest it then indeed must we all starve
test1313,the grand dame whom he supplied with fagging the merchant whom he rescued from robbers the king's counselor to whom he gave aid all became his friends up and down the land to begger or
test1314,to him who could bring her back to her father's castle should be given the throne and kingdom as well as the princess herself so from far and near indeed from almost every country under the sun came knights
test1315,among those who drew back was elthered's brothers the three that were dark and the three that were fair.
test1316,butethel he had not their tauts.
test1317,so they all cried out long and loud long live the prince prince is all.
test1318,he felt what the earth may possibly feel at the moment when it is torn open with the iron in order that grain may be deposited within it it feels only the wound the quiver of the grain the
test1319,he had but just acquired a faith must he then reject it already
test1320,he affirmed to himself that he would not he declared to himself that he would not doubt and he began to doubt in spite of himself
test1321,to stand between two religions from one of which you have not yet emerged and another into which you have not yet entered is intolerable and twilight is pleasing only to bat like souls
test1322,marias was clear-eyed and he required the true light
test1323,the half lights of doubt painted him.
test1324,whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was he could not halt there he was not irresistibly constrained to continue to advance to examine to think to march further
test1325,he feared after having taken so many steps which had brought him closer to his father to now take a step which would attract him from that father
test1326,his discomfort was augmented by all the reflections which occurred to him.
test1327,in the troubled state of his conscience he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence
test1328,they soon elbows him abruptly.
test1329,"request co-racf for to come and talk with me, said marisa."
test1330,"what is to become of you, said curarac."
test1331,what are you going to do i do not know
test1332,silver gold here it is.
test1333,you will then have only a pair of shoes a westcut a hat and a coat and my coat and my boots
test1334,that will be enough.
test1335,"no, it is not good what will you do after that?"
test1336,do you know german no?
test1337,it is badly paid work but one can live by it
test1338,the clothes dealer was sent for.
test1339,he paid twenty franks for the cast off garments they went to the watchmakers.
test1340,he bought the watch for forty five francs
test1341,"hello, i'd forgotten that, said marisa."
test1342,the landowner presented his bill which had to be paid on the spot.
test1343,"i have ten franks left, said maria."
test1344,that will be swallowing a tongue very fast or a hundred sue very slowly
test1345,one morning on his return to the law school mary's found a letter from his aunt and the sixty pistol that is to say six hundred francs and gold in a sealed box
test1346,maria sent back the thirty lily to his aunt with a respective letter in which he said that he had sufficient means of subsistence and that he should be able to lens forth to supply
test1347,at that moment he had three franks left.
test1348,he perceived that it was no good to talking to the old men and that the principal person in the house was the mother
test1349,before her he decided to scatter her pearls
test1350,the princess was distracted and did not know what to do she felt she had sent against kitty
test1351,well doctor decide my fate said the princess tell me everything
test1352,is there hope she meant to say but her lips wavered and she could not out the question doctor
test1353,as you please the princess went out with a sigh
test1354,the family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his observations
test1355,and there are indicators malnutrition nervous excitementability and so on
test1356,the question asks thus in presence of indications of tuberculosis process what is to be done to maintain nutrition
test1357,yes that's a understood thing responded to the celebrated physician again glancing at his watch
test1358,be sorry is the yoshie bridge down or shall i be to drive around
test1359,he asked ah it is
test1360,"oh well, then i can do it in twenty minutes"
test1361,and how about a travel around the world asked the family doctor
test1362,what is wanted is the means of improving nutrition and not for lowering it
test1363,the family doctor listened attentively and respectfully
test1364,but in favor of foreign travel i would urge the change of habits the removal from conditions calling up remembrance
test1365,and then the mother wishes it he had
test1366,ah well in that case to let them go only those gregorians are mischievous
test1367,oh time's up already and he went to the door
test1368,the celebrated doctor announced to the princess a feeling of what was done from his doing so that he ought to see the patient once more
test1369,oh no only a few details princess come this way
test1370,and the mother accompanied by the doctor went into the drawing room to kitty
test1371,the doctor came in she flushed kremnig and her eyes filled with tears
test1372,she answered him and all at once got up furious
test1373,"excuse me doctor, but there is really no object in this"
test1374,this is the third time you've asked me the same thing
test1375,the celebrated doctor did not offend a fence
test1376,nervous eritability he said to the princess when kitty had left the room however i had finished
test1377,and the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess as an exceptional intelligent woman the condition of the young girl and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters which were certainly harmful
test1378,at the question should they go abroad the doctor punched into a deep meditation as though resolving a weighty problem
test1379,finally his decision was pronounced they were to go abroad but to put no faith in foreign quacks and to apply him to him in any need
test1380,it seemed as if some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the doctor had gone
test1381,the mother was much more cheerful when she went back to her daughter and kitty pretended to be more cheerful
test1382,educated people of the upper classes are trying to stifle the ever-growing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social order
test1383,this is absolutely incorrect
test1384,in the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interest for the interest of the group
test1385,the champions of the social conception of life usually try to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea of moral influence but this connection is quite impossible
test1386,the man who is controlled by moral influence acts in accordance with his own desires
test1387,the basis of authority is bodily violence
test1388,the possibility of applying bodily violence to people is provided above all by an organization of armed men trained to act in unity and submission to one will
test1389,these bands of armed men submission to a single will are what constitute the army
test1390,the army has always been and still is the basis of power
test1391,power is always in the hands of those who control the army and all men in power from the roman cesar's to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their army than in anything
test1392,indeed it could not be otherwise
test1393,only under those conditions could the social organization be justified
test1394,but since this is not the case and on the contrary men in power are always far from being saints through the very fact of their possession of power the social organization based on power has no justification
test1395,even if there was once a time when owing to the low standards of morals and the disposition of men to violence the existence of an authority to restrict such violence was an advantage because the violence of the government
test1396,between the members of one state subject to a single authority the strike between the individuals seemed still less and the life of the state seems even more secure
test1397,it was produced on one hand by the natural growth of population and on the other by struggle in conquest
test1398,after conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to internal decisions and so the state conception of life justifies itself
test1399,but this justification is never more than temporary
test1400,internal desisions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression exerted by the authority over the desistent individuals
test1401, government authority even if it does suppress private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the government
test1402,and therefore the oppression of the oppressed always goes on growing up to the farthest limit beyond which it cannot go without killing the goose with the golden eggs
test1403,the most convincing example of this is to be found in the condition of the classes of our era who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient time subbed by conquest
test1404,so it has always been
test1405, footnote the fact that in america the abuus of authority exist in spite of a small number of their troops not only fails to disprove this position but positively confirms it
test1406,the upper classes know that an army of fifty thousand will soon be insufficient and no longer relying on pankentens men they think that the security of their position depends on the increased strength of the army
test1407,the reason to which he gave expression is essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the pope's engage swiss and scot guards and makes the russians of the center districts and the
test1408,the meaning of kippev's speech put in plain language is that is needs are not to resist foreign enemies but to buy officers to be ready to act against the slave toiling masses
test1409,and this abnormal order of thanks is maintained by the army
test1410,but there is not only one government there are other governments exploiting their subjects by violence in the same way and are always ready to pounce down on any other government and carry off the fruits of the to
test1411,and so every government needs an army also to protect its bumbs from its brothergins
test1412,this increase is dangerous as montsue pointed out a hundred and fifty years ago
test1413,every increase in the army of one state with the aim of self defense against its subjects becomes a source of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies
test1414,the despotism of a government always increases with the strength of the army and its external successes and the aggression of a government increases with its internal despotism
test1415,the rivalry of the european states in constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse to universal military service because by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers is obtained at the least
test1416,and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the inequities practiced upon them all citizens have become their own impressors
test1417,this inconsistency has become obvious in universal military service
test1418,in fact the whole significance of the social concept of life consists in man's recognition of the barbarity of struggle between individuals and the transpiration of personal life itself and the transfer of the aim of life
test1419,but with universal military service it comes to past that men after every sacrifice to get out of the cruelty of strike and the insecurity of existence are called upon to face the peril that they had meant to avoid
test1420,but instead of doing that they exposed the individuals to the same necessity of strike substituting strike individuals of other states for strike neighbors
test1421,the taxes were raised from the people for war preparations absorb the greater part of the products of labor which the army should to defend
test1422,the danger of war ever ready to break out makes all reforms of life social life vain and fruitless
test1423,but the fatal significance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent in the social concept of life is not only apparent in that
test1424,government asserts that armies are needed above for all external defense but that is not true
test1425,they are needed primarily against their subjects and every man under universal military service becomes an companion in all the acts of violence of the government against the citizens without any choice of his own
test1426,and for the sake of what am i making them
test1427,i'm expected for the sake of a state to make these sacrifices to make these sacrifices to man peace family security and human dignity
test1428,except for the state they say we should be exposed to the attacks of evil disposed people in our own country
test1429,we now know that threats and punishments cannot reduce their number that that can only be done by change of environment and moral influence
test1430,so that the justification of state violence on the ground of the protection that gives us from evil disposed people even if it had a foundation three or four centuries ago has none ever know
test1431,except for the state they tell us we should not have any religion education culture means of communication and so
test1432,without the state men would not have been able to form the social institutions needed for doing anything
test1433,this argument too was well founded only some centuries ago
test1434,the great extension of means of communication and intersection of ideas has made men completely able to dispense with state aid in informing societies associations corporations and congresses for scientific economic and political objects
test1435,without governments nations would be enslaved by their neighbors
test1436,the government they tell us with its army is necessary to defend us from neighboring states who might slave us
test1437,and if defense against barbarian nations is meant one thousand part of the troops now under arms would be ample enough for that purpose
test1438,the power of the state far from being a security against the attacks of our neighbors exposes us on the contrary to much greater danger of such attacks
test1439,even looking at it practically wang that is to say all the laid on him by the state man cannot fail to see that for him personally to comply with the state demands and serve in the army would
test1440,to resist would need independent thought and effort of which every man is able
test1441,so much for the advantages and disadvantages of both lines of conduct for a man of a wealthy class an oppressor
test1442,for a man of the poor class the advantages and disadvantages will be the same but with a great increase of disadvantages
test1443,say you know something?
test1444,criss looked from a nickel plated flashlight to a carjack and spark plug.
test1445,no who needs a job ban that's jake eris
test1446,okay you said.
test1447,only why didn't you ask him yourself?
test1448,mike became easy and fished it in an elastic band out of his pocket made a flip of a paper and sent it souring out into em street
test1449,well he admitted i did.
test1450,chris asked for the first time that day the heavy weight he carried within him lifted and lightened a little.
test1451,think he really needs it he pursued.
test1452,he would have to get the job for jake who needed it but perhaps some task of facing mr. wicker especially now that the light was going and dusk edged into the streets was not what ch
test1453,mike's expression changed to what wants to one to triumph but gris was only partially encouraged.
test1454,i think you're going after all it's turnin' into him
test1455,mike was standing on the corner.
test1456,oh shocks!
test1457,chris started off once more passing a bleak little victorian church perched on the hill above mr. worker's house.
test1458,an empty lot cut into by church lane gave a look of isolation to the al shape brick building that served mr. wicker's both house in place of business.
test1459,the longer wing towards the back got a back door that opened on a water street the space between the house in washington avenue had been made into a neat oblon flower garden fenced off from the side
test1460,a livid yellow stain the horizon beyond the factories and glay clouds lower and tumbed above.
test1461,the air was growing chill and chris decided to finish the job.
test1462,all at once you wondered how his mother was and everything in him pinched and tightened itself.
test1463,at the foot of the hill he reached the house
test1464,there were three things that always caught his eye ahead of the litter of dusty pieces.
test1465,"on the left the coil of rope in the center the model of a sailing ship in a green glass bottle and on the right the wooden statue of a negeri boy and baggy trousers, tur"
test1466,"but the name still showed at the pro, and many a time, chris safe in home and bed had sailed imaginary voyages in the mirror bell,"
test1467,he had never seen anyone go into mr. worker's shop now he thought of that.
test1468,how then did he live? and what did he ever sell?
test1469,a sudden carhorn walked from this dream.
test1470,of many times he examined mr. mr. ricker's window and poured over the rope the ship and the nubian boy he had never gone into mr. mr. shop.
test1471,so now alone until someone should answer the bell they looked eagerly if easily around him
test1472,what with the one window in the lower right day outside the long narrow shop was somber.
test1473,heavy hand uned beams crossed it from one side to the other.
test1474,"the joker's back being towards the source of light, chris could not see his face."
test1475,the double fans and minute rinkles breaking from eye corner to temple and joining with those over the cheeks were drawn into the horizontal lines across the domed forehead
test1476,little tuffs of white fuzz above the ears were all that remained of the antiquary's hair but what drew and held chris's gaze were the old man's eyes
test1477,chris blinks looked again yes they were still there
test1478,chris swaled he's voice came back to him.
test1479,"yes, sir, you said."
test1480,i saw your sign and i know a boy who needs the job.
test1481,"he's a school made of mine,"
test1482,"jackie harris's name is, and he really needs the job."
test1483,i i just wondered if the place was still open
test1484,what he saw was a fresh cheeked lad tall for thirteen sturdy with sincerity and good humor in his face and something sensitive and appealing about his eyes
test1485,he guesses there must be a lively fire in that beyond
test1486,would that interfere with jakeggy's getting the job sir?
test1487,but even as he slowly turned the thought pierced his mind why had he not seen the reflection of the headlights of the cars moving up around the corner of wall under street not the hill towards the d
test1488,the room seemed overly still
test1489,then in that second he turned and faced about
test1490,the wad bawl window was there before him and three objects he like showing frosty in the moonlight that poured into from across the water
test1491,across the water where was the freeway
test1492,it was no longer there nor were the high walls and smokestacks of factories to be seen
test1493,the warehouses were still there.
test1494,"flabagged and breathless, chris was unaware that he had moved closer to appear out of the window in every direction."
test1495,no electric signs no lampled streets.
test1496,where the people's drug store had stood but half an hour before rose the walls of what was undoubtedly an in
test1497,a courtroom was first lit by flaring torture to showing a swinging sign hanging on a post
test1498,the post was blended at the edge of it was now a broad and money road
test1499,a coach with its top pilled high with luggage stamped to a halt beside the flagged courtyard
test1500,"they moved into the inn, the coach driver rattled off to the stable."
test1501,my window has a power for those few who are to see.
test1502,the learning of magic was by no means easy
test1503,he told his master at once about simon gosling his herd of money and his hiding places for it.
test1504,chris therefore threw himself into all the premaries of his task.
test1505,one afternoon when he had returned after arrest to mister worker's study he saw that there was something new in the room a ball with a gold fish in it stood on the table the mr. worker
test1506,what will i all do first?
test1507,how you've been improved my boy he exclaimed is now a time for you to try this is this will be a change as if it's going to change as well
test1508,suppose i change and can't change back.
test1509, worker worker waited patiently beside him for a few moments for chris to get up his courage.
test1510,then there is nothing happened with a voice like a wip. mr. wiser said started once once
test1511,a sensation spread faster and faster.
test1512,his head swapped and he felt faint and a little sick but he resisted through the final words
test1513,"he thought, not without a feeling of pride and began experimenting with his tail and fins with such enthusiasm and delight that some little time emerged before mr. worker's voice, boom, buss by"
test1514,seventy four book one the return
test1515,the figure shoes carved in some eastern style at curved down pointing toes
test1516,then all that once the idea came to chris.
test1517,if he was to be a magician could he make this boy come to life?
test1518,"he squed on his hons, examined the carved wood and figure attentively and felt convinced that once alive the boy would be an ideal and happy companion"
test1519,but how did one a change inanimate to animate?
test1520,gris got up and stole back to mr. worker's door.
test1521,you heard that magician going up the spiral staircase to his room above and after changing himself to a mouse to slip under the door and see that the room was really empty mr. doom's proper shape
test1522,the afternoon rainy before increased in storm
test1523,thus came two hours before its time thunder snarled in the sky
test1524, certain elements were to be mixed and poured at the proper time
test1525,the worker began moving about upstairs the floorboard creaked creaked creaked and still chris could not leave until the founton fumed and glowed
test1526,with infinite caution chris closed the doors the silently behind him and running lightly forward reached the figure of the neegro boy.
test1527,it was as if the stiffness melted.
test1528,"under his eyes, wooltholds of cloth became rich silk embroidery glimmered in his reality upon the coat and oh the face"
test1529,the wooden grin loosened the large eyes turned the hand hand holding the hard boko of carved flowers moved then that boko fall
test1530,they went down to their quarters first
test1531,gust mr. finny went to his quarters i don't remember seeing him cross the deck or come over that way at all
test1532,next nead silly was being called to the helm by elbert jones who took over nead went on down
test1533,it looks to me as if it could have been one of several people and i'll be switched if i know who i'll keep my eyes open
test1534,the mirror bell was nearings a thadhi.
test1535,we've water in fresh stores to tick on there
test1536,chris lost no time as soon as he could do it without being noticed in hurrying down to his cabin.
test1537, certainly my boy boomed up the captain's blue eyes suddenly keen in penetrating
test1538,mr. finnill would be some time on deck we cannot be other than he has not been heard in here
test1539,his face rose with nervousness that this might not do as an answer and he stood stiff and still before captain lizard
test1540,the captain sat forward in his chair looking at him for a long moment considering
test1541,then he said well i do not care for it i cannot say i do.
test1542,this ship is more to me than wife or mother or family
test1543,"and pause, fingered his lower lip, looking sideways in a reflective fashion at chris standing before him"
test1544,"we will say no more, but i trust you understand the responsibility you have."
test1545,the ship its cargo and its men will be in your hands
test1546,yes sir i think i can do it safely or i should not try sir
test1547,"captain blizzard's round pink face, creeks in its winning smile"
test1548,he then went on to describe what else was to follow the covering of the ship with leaves to make it blend with its surroundings.
test1549,the camouflage was not a word the captain or any one of his time he had understood
test1550,"what can be said during that time, sir, chris thought not ask"

test1554,he knew now that his absence for as long as he had to be away would be covered up and satisfyingly accounted for
test1555,their conversation had taken some little while.

test1566,put on heavy shoes and some all dark clothes and make up your mind not to be surprised at anything
test1567,lily was sleeping of the sleep of the just when i went up stairs and i hunted out my things carefully
test1568,they were talking confidently together but when i came down they ceased
test1569,there were a few preparations to be made the locks to be gone over winter's to be instructed as renewed vigilance and then after destroying the whole light we crept in the darkness through the front door
test1570,i ask no questions
test1571,once only somebody spoke and then it was an enfrance with a profanity from dr. steward when he ran into a wire fence
test1572,i even know what i expected
test1573,the doctor was puffing somewhat where we finally came to a halt
test1574,i confess that just at that minute even sunny side seemed a cheerful spot
test1575,in spite of myself i drew my breath in sharply
test1576,it was alex armed with two long handled spades
test1577,the doctor kept a keen lookout but no one appeared
test1578,there is one thing sure i'll not be suspected of complexity

test1596,yes yes

test1609,the key of my desk in fact was at that moment in the lock and the others were attached to it
test1610,now then sneered he we must have a confiscation of property
test1611,and putting the keys into his pocket he walked into the library
test1612,that and all replied the master and the things were cleared away

test1651,after that they would prepare to their country home
test1652,captain leek did not look at all like in london dandy now.
test1653,there was a very natural savagery and rejection there and a wild leer in his yellow eyes rachel sat down.
test1654,a slave only think a slave.
test1655,"oh frightful, frightful is it? is it a dream?"
test1656,"oh, frightful, frightful."
test1657,stanley stanley it would be mercy to kill me she broke her again.
test1658,bright and natty with the jins curtains and the little toilet set out not in elegantly and her pet piping goldfrench asleep on his perch with a bit of sugar between the wires of
test1659,when he came back to the drawing room a toilet bottle of over the colone in his hand with her lay's hand handkerchief he bated her temples in front of head.
test1660,there was nothing very brotherly in his look as he peared into his pale sharp features during the process.
test1661,there don't mind me she said sharply and getting up she looked down at her dress and thin shoes and seeming to recall herself she took the candle he had just set down and went quickly to her room
test1662,and she threw back her wail and going quickly to the toilet mechanically surveyed herself in the glass
test1663,"rachel leek, rachel leek, what are you now?"
test1664,"i'll stay here that is, that is in the drawing room she answered and the face was withdrawn."
test1665,he slank a space and tapped sharply at the little window of the little window of the maddest post office at which the young ladies in the pony carriage had pulled up the day before and within which
test1666,look took care of mr. luke's dogs and groomed mr. wilder's horse and cleaned up his dog cart for mark being clothes about money and finding that the thing was to be
test1667,but luke was not there and captain lake recalling his habits and his hound hurried on to the silver lion which has its cable towards the common only about a hundred steps away for distances are not great
test1668,here where the flow of soul and of stout long pipes long yarns and tolerable long credits and the humble cape crases of the town resided to thier for the pleasures of
test1669,no lose time and i'll give half a crown.
test1670,luke stokehouse is greezy wide awake and in a few minutes more the door cut was trundled out into the lane and the horse hense went between the shelves with that
test1671,if i thought you had failed me now toma i should never come back good night toma.
test1672,the act said that in case of difference of opinion there must be a ballot.
test1673,he went up to the table and striking it with his finger ring he shouted loudly a ball
test1674,he was shouting for the very coarse suriyevinavh had proposed but it was evident that he hated him and all his party and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and r
test1675,shouts were raised and for a moment all was confusion so that the marshal of the province had to call for order a ballot
test1676,we shed our blood for our country.
test1677,the confidence of the monarch no checking the accounts of the marshal he is not a casher but that's not the point
test1678,voting please biey.
test1679,they expressed the most implacable hatred.
test1680,levin did not in the least understand what was a matter and he marveled at the passion with which it was disputed whether or not the decision about flare of should be put to the vote
test1681,he forgot as sir jevinov explained to him afterward this syllogism that it was necessary for the public good to get rid of the marshal of the province that to get
test1682,but levin forgot all that and it was painful to him to see all these excellent people for whom he had a respect in such an un pleasant and vicious state of excitement
test1683,to escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the workers at the freshman bar.
test1684,he particularly like the way one gray whistled writer who showed his corn for the other younger ones and was jaded at by them was teaching them how to fold up napkins properly
test1685,lives advanced but utterly forgetting what he was to do and much embarrassed he turned to sergey evinck with a question where am i to put it
test1686,so you even a bit brown.
test1687,that is a matter for each man's decision he said severely
test1688,having put it in he recalled that he ought to have thrust his left hand too and so he thrusted him though too late and still more overcome with confusion he beat a hasty retreat into the
test1689,a hundred and twenty six for admission eighty eight against
test1690,sang the voice of the secretary who could not pronounce the letter r.
test1691,then there was a laugh a button and two notes were found in the box
test1692,but the old party did not consider themselves conquered.
test1693,in reply snetcoff spoke of the trust the noblemen of the province had placed in him the effect they had shown him which he did not deserve as his only merit had been his attachment to
test1694,this expression in the marshall's face was particularly touching to levin because only the day for he had been at his house about his trusty business and had seen him in all his grandeur a
test1695,if there are men younger and more deserving than i let them serve
test1696,and the marshal disappeared through a side door.
test1697,they were to proceed immediately to the election.
test1698,two noble gentlemen who had a weakness for strong drink had been made drunk by the parties of snakcov and a third had been robbed of his uniform.
test1699,on learning this the new party had made haste during the dispute about flareoff to send some of their men in a sled to clothes the stripped gentlemen and to bring along one of the intoxicated
test1700,levin did not care to eat and he was not smoking he did not want to join his own friends that is sara evenin stepanakarik evenin and s
test1701,he went to the window and sat down scanning the groups and listening to what was being said around him
test1702,he's such a black god.
test1703,i have told him so but it makes no difference only think of it
test1704,these people were unknowingly seeking a place where they could talk without being overheard
test1705,shall we go on your excellence fine champagne
test1706,last year at our district marshall nicole evinson
test1707,oh still just the same always at a loss the land owner answered with a resigned smile but with an expression of serenity and conviction that that it must be
test1708,"why, what is there to understand?"
test1709,there is no meaning in it at all
test1710,then two must keep up connections
test1711,it's a moral obligation of an assault.
test1712,and then to tell the truth there's one's own interests
test1713,they are proprietaries of a sort but we are the land owners
test1714,that it may be but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully
test1715,if we are laying out a garden planning one before the house you know and there you have a tree that stood with centuries in the very spot old and nals may be and yet you don't cut
test1716,well and how is your land doing?
test1717,but one's work is thrown in for nothing
test1718,"oh well, one does it what would you have?"
test1719,and what more the landowner went on leaning his elbows in the window and chatting on my son i must tell you has no taste for it
test1720,so there will be no one to keep it up and yet one does it
test1721,we walked about the fields and the garden no sara sheah on staples missive everything's well looked after but your gardens neglected
test1722,to my thinking i'd cut down that tree.
test1723,here you have thousands of limes and each would make two good bundles of park
test1724,you're married i heard said the landowner
test1725,"yes, it's rather strange. he went on."
test1726,the landowner chockled under his white moustaches
test1727,why don't we cut down our parks for timber
test1728,said eleven returning to a thought the rads struck him
test1729,there is a class instinct too of what one ought to ought to do
test1730,there's the peasants too i wonder at them sometimes any good peasant tries to take all the land he can
test1731,without a return to any simple loss
test1732,when he came from the bath proclus visited him again
test1733,butharmon was not in the mood to share a joyous revell and he frankly said so although immediately after his return he had accepted the invitation to the festival which the whole fellowship of artists would
test1734,she would appear herself at dessert and the banquet must therefore begin at an unusual early hour
test1735,so the artist found himself obliged to relieve his opposition.
test1736,the banquet was to begin in a few hours yet he could not let the day pass without seeing daffy and telling her the words of the oracle
test1737,he longed with ardent yearning for the sound of her voice and still more to unburden his sorely troubled soul to her
test1738,since his return from the oracle the fear that the rescue demeter might yet be the work of mertis had yet be the work of mertis had again mastered him
test1739,the approval as well as the doubts which it arose in others strengthened his opinion although even now he could not succeed in bringing it into harmony with the facts
test1740,then he went directly to the neighboring palace the queen might have appeared already and it would not do to keep her waiting
test1741,hither the merchant had been induced it is true to advance large sums of money to the queen but the loyal devotion which she showed to her royal husband had rendered it impossible to give him even a hint
test1742,when herman entered the residents of the gramaatia in the palace the guests had already assembled.
test1743,the place by herman's side which althea had chosen for herself would then be given up to army.
test1744,true an interesting conversation still had power to charm him but often during its continueings the full consciousness of his misfortune forced itself upon his mind for the majority of the subjects discussed by the artists came to
test1745,a stranger out of his own sphere he felt chilled among these closely united men and women to whom no tay bound him save the presence of the same host
test1746,cats had really been invited in order to win him over to the queen's cause and charming fair harred niko had been commissioned by the conspirators to persuade him to sing arson's prizes
test1747,his son had been the royal dama's first husband and she had desided him to marry lamasca the aged king of threas
test1748,the king's sister the object of his love cried harmon credulously
test1749,we woman is only as old as we look and the leek's entering woman of this beauty of forty practice arts which give her the appearance of twenty five yet perhaps the king's intelligence more than
test1750,the three most trustworthy one's are here amitshes the leech crispis and the admirable procras
test1751,let us hope that you will make this three leafed clover the luck promising four leafed one
test1752,your uncle too has often with praise worthy generosity helped ason in many a embarrassment
test1753,how long he kept you waiting from the first word concerning a work which justly transported the whole city with delight
test1754,when he did finally summon you he said things which must have warned you
test1755,that is going too far replied harman.
test1756,he winked at her and made a significant gesture as he spoke and then informed the blind artist how graciously arnort had remembered him when she heard of the remedy by who's many a wonderful
test1757,the royal lady had asked about him and his suffering with almost sisterly interest and althia eagerly confirmed the statement
test1758,her mom listened to the parent's silence
test1759,the rodyan was just beginning to praise arson also as a special friend and connoisseur of the sculpture's art when crats herman's fellow student asked the blind artist in behalf of
test1760,yet what mattered it even if these miserable people considered themselves deceived and pointed the finger of scorn at him
test1761,a woman who wishes for the regard of all men and makes love to a toy easily lessens the demands she imposes upon individuals
test1762,only even though love has fully disappeared she still claims consideration and althea did not wish to lose harmon's regard
test1763,how indifferent you look but i tell you her deep blue eyes flashed as she spoke that so long as you were still a genuine creating artist the case was different
test1764,though so loud a denial is written on your face i persist in my conviction and that no idle delusion and snas me i can prove
test1765,it was nay it could have been nothing else that very spider
test1766,not a sound if you value your lives.
test1767,to offer resistance would have been madness for even harmon perceived by the loud clanging of weapons around them the greatly superior power of the enemy and they were acting by the orders of the king to
test1768,was he to be led to the executioners block
test1769,what pleasure had life to offer him the blind man who was already dead to his art.
test1770,are he not to greet his sudden end as a boom from the immortals?
test1771,did it not spare him a humiliation as great and painful as could be imagined.
test1772,whatever might await him he desired no better fate.
test1773,if he had passed into elimination he hermon wished to follow him thither and injury certainly meant redemption from pain and misery
test1774,but if they were destined to meet his mortals and his mother in the world beyond the grave what had he not to tell them how sure he was of finding a joyful reception there from both
test1775,the power which delivered him over to death just at that moment was not nemesis no it was a kindly deity
test1776,yet it was no illusion that deceived him.
test1777,again he heard the beloved voice and this time it addressed not only him but with the most haste the commander of the soldiers
test1778,sometimes with touching and treaty sometimes with imperial command she protested after giving him her name that this matter could be nothing but an unfortunate mistake
test1779,then lastly with earnest warmth she beasted him before taking the prisoners away to allow her to speak to the commander general philippus her father's guest who she was sure was in the palace
test1780,cried harmon in great agitation but she would not listen to him and follow the soldier whom whom the captain detail to guide her into the palace
test1781,today you will confess to me who treacherously directed you to this dangerous path.
test1782,daffy again pleaded for the liberation of the prisoners but philip's silence charged with the grave exclamation the order of the king
test1783,as soon as the captive artist was alone with a woman he loved he clasped her hand pouring forth into coherent words of the most ardent gratitude and when he felt her warmly return the pressure he
test1784,in spite of his deep mental distress he could have shouted loud in his delight and gratitude.
test1785,he might now have been permitted to bind forever to his life the woman who had just rescued him from the greatest danger but the confession he must make to his fellow artists in the plush of the following
test1786,i love you and have loved you always.
test1787,davon exclaimed tenderly what more is needed
test1788,"but harmon, with drooping head murmured tomorrow i shall no longer be what i am now"
test1789,then daphne raised your face to his asking so the demeter is the work of meritist
test1790,what a terrible odor again awaits you.
test1791,and i fool blind also in mind could be vexed with you for it.
test1792,bring this before your mind and everything else that you must accept with it if you consent when the time arrives to become mine conceal in paley nothing
test1793,so akai intended to leave the city on one of his own ships that very day
test1794,he himself on the way to expose himself to the malice and mockery of the whole city.
test1795,his heart contracted painfully and his request about his uncle's fate increased when philip informed him that the conspirators had been arrested at the banquet and headed by amemetes the riddon
test1796,besides he knew that the object of his love would not part from him without granting him one last word
test1797,on the way his heart thrapped almost bursting
test1798,even daphne's image and what threatened her father and her with him went far into the background
test1799,he was appearing before his companions only to give truth it's just do.
test1800,the egyptian obey and his master crossed the wide space strewed with sand and approached the stage which had been erected for the festive performances even had his eyes retain the power of sight his blood
test1801,shouted his friend sartal and joyful surprise in the midst of his painful walk harmon.
test1802,even while he believed himself to be the creator of the demeter he had been seriously troubled by the praise of so many critics because it had exposed him to the suspicion of having become faithless to his
test1803,honor to mertel and his art but he trusted the noble feastallassume would pardon the unintentional deception and gave his prayer for recovery
test1804,afterward it was supposed that he was satisfied with a blood of oxon lamps and doves and that in exchange for orson lamps and doves and that in exchange for orson's sacrifices this
test1805,whether he was the creator of yourself and myself
test1806,whether and the prayer was ever answered
test1807,why did he create the intellectual inferior
test1808,why did he create the deformed and helpless why did he create the criminal the idiotic the insane
test1809,are the failures under obligation to their creator
test1810,is he responsible for all the wars that have been raged for all the innocent blood that has been shed
test1811,is he responsible for the centuries of slavery for the backs that have been scared with a lash for the babies that have been sold from the breasts of mothers for the families that have been separated and destroyed
test1812,is this god responsible for religious persecution for the inquisitors for the tomb screw and rack and for all the instruments of torture
test1813,did this got allowed the cruel and vile to destroy the brave and virtuous
test1814,did he allow tyrants to shed the blood of patriots
test1815,can we conceive of a devil bays enough to prefer his enemies to his friends
test1816,how can we account for the wild beasts that the war human beings for the fanged serpents whose bite is death
test1817,how can we account for a world where life feeds on life
test1818,did infinite wisdom intentionally produced the microcosm beasts that feed upon the optical nature think of blinding a man to satisfy the appetite of a microcosm
test1819,fear fear builds the altar and offers the sacrifice
test1820,fear erased the cathedral and bows the head of man in worship
test1821,lit's religious and fearful trembling repeated his passage though he slayed me yet will i trust him
test1822,can we say that he cared for the children of man?
test1823,can we say that is mercy endured for ever
test1824,do he prove his goodness by showing that he has opened the earth and swallowed thousands of his helpless children or that with the volcanoes he has overwhelmed them with rivers of fire
test1825,was their goodness what was their wisdom in this
test1826,or the superior rise to singcut that they are not the inferior
test1827,most people linked to the supernatural
test1828,if they give up one god they imagine another
test1829,what is this power?
test1830,man advances and necessarily advances to experience.
test1831,a man wishing to go to a certain place comes to where the road divides
test1832,he has tried that road and knows that it is the wrong road.
test1833,a child shown by the beauty of the flame grasped it with his dimpled hand
test1834,the power that works for righteousness had taught the child a lesson
test1835,it is a result.
test1836,it is insisted by these theologists and by many of the so called philosophers that this moral sense this sense of duty of responsibility was important and that conscience is an exotic
test1837,"we live together in families, tribes and nations."
test1838,"they are praised, admired and respected."
test1839,they are regarded as good that is to say as moral
test1840,the members who add to the misery of the family the tribe of the nation are considered bad members
test1841,the greatest of human beings had said conscience is born of love
test1842,as people advance the remote consequences are perceived.
test1843,the imagination is cultivated.
test1844,a man puts himself in the place of another.
test1845,the sense of duty becomes stronger more imperative.
test1846,man judges himself
test1847,in all this there is nothing supernatural.
test1848,man has deceived himself
test1849,has christianity done good
test1850,when the church had control were men made better and happier
test1851,what has religion done for hungary or austin
test1852,could these countries have been worse without religion
test1853,could have been worse had they had any other religion than christianity
test1854,what did christianity do for them?
test1855,they hated pleasure
test1856,they muffled all the bells of happiness
test1857,the religion of the puritan was an unadultated curse
test1858,the puritans believe the bible to be the word of god and this belief has always made those who held it cruel and ruthless
test1859,let me refer to just one fact showing the influence of a believe in the bible on human beings
test1860,the queen received the bible kissed it and pledged herself to delicately read there
test1861,in other words it was just as fennish just as infamous as the catholic spirit
test1862,has the bible made the people of georgia kind and compassionate
test1863, religion has been tried and in all countries in all times has failed
test1864, religion has always been the enemy of science of investigation and thought
test1865, religion has never made men free
test1866,it has never made man moral a temperate industrial and honest
test1867,are christian's more tempered nearer virtuous nearer honest than savages
test1868,can we cure disease by supplication
test1869,can we receive virtue or honor as arms
test1870, religion rests on the idea that nature has a master and that this master will listen to prayer that this master punishes and rewards that he loves prayer and flattery and hates the brave and free
test1871,we must have corn the stones
test1872,the structure must have a basement
test1873,if we build we must begin at the bottom
test1874,i have a theory and i have four cornerstones
test1875,the first stone is that matter substance can't be destroyed can't be eliminated
test1876,if these cornerstones are facts it follows as a necessity that matter and force are from and force are from end to eternity that they can neither be increased or diminished
test1877,it follows that nothing has been or can be created that there never has been or can be a creator that there never has been or can be a creator
test1878,it follows that there could not have been any intelligence any design back of matter and force
test1879,i say what i think
test1880,every event has parents.
test1881,that which has not happened could not
test1882,in the infinite chain ribs and there can be no broken no missing link
test1883,we now know that our first parents were not foreigners
test1884,we now know if we know anything that the universe is natural and that men and women have been naturally produced
test1885,we know the parts that life has traveled
test1886,we know the steps of advance they have been traced
test1887,for thousands of years men and women have been trying to reform the world.
test1888,why have the reformers failed?
test1889,they depend on the lord on luck and charity
test1890,they live by fraud and violence and be quit their vices to their children
test1891, failure seems to be the trademark of nature why
test1892,nature produced without purpose sustains without intention and destroys without thought
test1893,must the world ever remain the victim of ignorant passion
test1894,why should men and women have children that they can not take care of children that are a burden and curses why
test1895,p passion is and always has been death.
test1896,law can punish but it can neither reform criminals or prevent crime
test1897,this cannot be done by talk or example
test1898,this is the solution of the whole question
test1899,"this freezes women,"
test1900,poverty and crime will be childless
test1901,it is far better to be free to leave the thoughts and barricades of fear to stand erect and face the future with a smile
test1902,there done far said the school master in a low key to the shewt out with your vittarial and mind your eye
test1903,the two monsters took off their shoes and moved stealthily along keeping in the shadows of the houses.
test1904,by means of this strategy they followed so closely that though in a few steps of sara and tom they did not hear them
test1905,sara and her brother having again passed by the tuppa frank arrived close to the dilated house which was partly in ruins and its open cells formed a kind of gulf along which the
test1906,in an instant the school master with a leap resembling in strength and agility the spring of a tiger seized seaten with one hand by the throat and exclaimed your money or i will fling you into this
test1907,no said the all broft drummingly no not one ring what a shame
test1908,tom tom sean did not lose his presence of mind during this scene rapidly and unexpectedly as it had occurred.
test1909,"ooh, ah, to lay a trap to catch us, replied the thief."
test1910,then addressing thomas sean you know the plane of st. denny
test1911,did you see in the cabin we had just left for i know you again the man who whom the charkolman came to seek
test1912,cried the school master a thousand franks and i'll kill him.
test1913,"witch, i do not see his life, replied sara to the schoolmaster,"
test1914,let's go and meet him.
test1915,"all by, it will pay for looking after."
test1916,well my wife will be there said the school master you will tell her what you want and i will see
test1917,in the plain of saint s. a. n.
test1918,between sentent and the road of the revolution at the end of the road agreed.
test1919,"he had forgotten the address of the self-styled pan painter,"
test1920,the fihac started
test1921, france who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the single fascination that this mysterious person
test1922,my very good friend an excellent neighbor replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my triffling exertsions
test1923,my father the count of morse although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of france and madrid and i hesitantly placed the best services of myself and all to whom i life
test1924,i can scarcely credit it.
test1925,then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have have meditated
test1926,shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day an hour in quiet the count only let me warn you that i am preverbal for my puntilled exactness in keeping my engagements day
test1927,so be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards the calendar suspended near the chimney piece he said today is the twenty first of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly half past
test1928,i reside in my father's house but occupy a pavilion at the farthest side of the courtyard and tie is separated from the main building
test1929,now then set the count returning his tablets to his pocket make yourself perfectly easy the hand of your time piece will not be more accurate in marking the time piece than myself
test1930,that depends when do you leave?
test1931,for france no for venice i shall remain in italy for another year or two
test1932,then we shall not meet in paris.
test1933,i fear i shall not have that honor
test1934,well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of each young man allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey
test1935,what is the matter asked albert of france when they had returned to their own apartments you seem more than commonly thought
test1936,i will confess to you albert replied france the count is a very unique person and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand appreciations
test1937,did you ever meet him previously to coming hither?
test1938,upon my honor then listen to me
test1939,he dwelled with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificent of his entertainment in the bretton of the thousand and one nights he recounted with
test1940,then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colonie between the count and vampani in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit pepino an
test1941,"but said franc, the korean bandits that were among the crew of his vessel,"
test1942,why really the thing seems to me simple enough.
test1943,"talking of countries replied france of what countries the count, what is his native dong when does he derive his immense fortune and what were his events of his early life a life as wonderful as unknown that"
test1944, certainly these are questions that in your place i should like to have answered.
test1945,my dear france replied abert when upon receipt of my letter you found the need of asking the count's assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend abert the morese is in danger helped
test1946,what are his means of existence? what is his birthplace of what countries are he a native?
test1947,i confess he asked me none no he merely came and freed me from the hands of senior vampire where i can assure you in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and un concern i did not very
test1948,and this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on albert's side.
test1949,"well said french with a sigh do as you please, my dear this count for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation"
test1950,"and now, my dear france, let us talk of something else."
test1951,then should anything appear to merit a more minor examination albert mosec could follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the consergees store and which
test1952,shrubs and creaking plants covered the windows and head from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the pringing eyes of the
test1953,at a quarter to ten a valentine entered he composed with a little room name john and who only spoke english all albert's establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and
test1954,wait then during the day tell rose that when i leave the opera i will sip with her as she wishes.
test1955,"very well at half hour ten,"
test1956,is the counters up yet?
test1957,the village left the room.
test1958,"good morning, russell, good morning, good morning said albert your punctuality really alarms me."
test1959,"you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was half passed,"
test1960,"no no, my dear fellow, do not confound our plans."
test1961,"yes, he has not much to complain of barge is the capital of charles the seventh."
test1962,it is for that reason you see me so early
test1963,i returned home at daybreak and stroft to sleep but my head ached and i got up to have a ride for a hour.
test1964,pets i will do nothing of the kind the moment they come from government you would find them excitable.
test1965," besides that, that does not concern the home but the financial department,"
test1966,about what about the papers?
test1967,"in the entire political world of which you are one of the leaders,"
test1968,they say that it is quite fair and that sowing so much red you ought to reep a little blue.
test1969,"come, come, that is not bad, said lucia."
test1970,"with your talents you would make your fortune in three or four years,"
test1971,the gentleman had not have had to sit down to become interested apparently he had taken up the volume from a table as soon as he came in and standing there after a single glance around the apartment had
test1972,that has an unflattering sound for me said the young man
test1973,she is willing to risk that.
test1974,just as i am the visitor questioned presenting himself with a workday aspect
test1975,he was tall and lean and dressed through out in black his shirt color was low and wide and the triangle of linen a little crumpled exhibited by the opening of his waistcoat was adorned
test1976,in spite of this decoration the young man looked poor it is poor as a young man could have who had such a fine head and such a magnificent eyes
test1977,those of basil ransom were dark deep and glowing his head had a character of elevation which fairly added to his statue it was a head to be seen above the level of the crowd on some judicial bench
test1978,these things the eyes especially with their smearing fire might have indicated that he was to be a great american statesman or on the other hand they might simply have shown that he was to be a great
test1979,and yet the reader who likes a complete image who desires to read with the senses as well as with the reason is interested not to forget that he prolonged his consonant name and swallowed his vocals that
test1980,and he took up his hat vaguely a soft black hat with a low crown and an immense straight brim
test1981,well so it is they are all witches and wizards mediums and spirit rappers and roaring radicals
test1982,if you are going to dinner with her you had better know it oh murder
test1983,he looked at mrs. lunar with intelligent incredibility
test1984,she was attractive and insignificant especially the latter.
test1985,have you been in europe?
test1986,"no, i've not been anywhere."
test1987,she hates it she would like to abolish it
test1988,this last remark he made at aventure for he had naturally not devoted his supposition whatever to missus leina
test1989,are you very ambitious you look as you wear
test1990,and missus luna added that now she was back she didn't know what she should do.
test1991,one didn't even know what one had come back for
test1992,besides ollie didn't want her in boston and didn't go through the form of saying so.
test1993,that was one comfort with oliver she never went through any forms
test1994,she stood there looking consciously and rather seriously and missed a mr. ransom a smile of exceeding faintness played about her lips it was just perceptable enough to light up the native gravity of her face
test1995,her voice was low and agreeable a cultivated voice and she extended a slender white hand to her visitor her remarked with some solemnity he felt a certain guilt of participation in missus luna's dis
test1996,he observed that miss chancellor's hand was at once called in limp he merely placed it in his without exerting the smallest pressure
test1997,i shall be back very late we'll be going to theater party that's why we dine so early
test1998,mrs. lucy's familiarity extended even to her sister she remarked to miss chance that she looked like if she was as if she got up for a sea voyage
test1999,pauleman announced this fact to himself as if he had made a great discovery but in reality he had never been so beoian as as at that moment
test2000,the women who had hitherto known had been mainly of his own soft climb and it was not often they exhibited the tendency he detected and curiously deplayed in missus loon's sister
test2001,ransom was pleased with the vision of that remedy it must be repeated that he was very prevational
test2002,he was sorry for her but he saw in a flash that no one could help her that was what made her tragic
test2003,she could not defend herself against a rich admiration a kind of tenderness of envy of anyone who had been so happy as to have that opportunity
test2004,his family was ruined they had lost their slaves their property their friends and relations their home had tasted of all the cruelty of defeat
test2005,the state of mississippi seemed to him the state of despair so he surrendered the remnant of his patrimony to his mother and sisters and at near thirty years of age delighted for the first time
test2006,it was in the female line as bale's ransom had written in her letter with a good deal of form and flourish he spoke as if they had been royal houses
test2007,if it had been possible to send missus ransom money or even clothes she would have been like that but she had no means of assessing in ensuring how such an offering would be taken
test2008,olive had a fear of everything but her greatest fear was of being afraid
test2009,she had erected it into a sort of rule of conduct that when she saw a risk she was to take it and she had frequent humiliation at finding herself safe after all
test2010,she was perfectly safe after writing baze ransom and indeed it was difficult to see what she could have done to her except thank her he was only exceptionally superlatively for her letter and assure her that
test2011,he was too simple two mississippi for that she was almost disappointed
test2012,of all things in the world contention was most sweet to her the why it is hard to imagine if she always caused her tears headaches a day or to in bed a acute emotion and it was very
test2013,miss channeles himself has thought so much on the vital subject would she not make a few remarks and give them some of her experiences?
test2014,how did the ladies and beekon street feel about the ballot?
test2015, perhaps she could speak for them more than for some others.
test2016,with her immense sympathy for reform she found herself so often wishing that reformers were a little different.
test2017,ollie had hated to hear that fine avenue talked about as if it was such a remarkable place and to live there were a proof of royal glory.
test2018,"all sorts of inferior people lived there and so brilliant a woman as woman is missus farron who lived at brackery, but not to mix things up."
test2019,she knew her place in the boston hierarchy and it was not what missus farron supposed so that there was a want of perspective in talking to her as if she had been a representative of
test2020,she wished to work in another field she had long been involved with the romance of the people.
test2021,this might be one of the most accessible of pleasures but in point of fact she had not found it so.
test2022,charlie was a young man in a white overcoat and a paper collar it was for him in the last analysis that they cared much the most
test2023,oil of chancellor wondered how missus fender would treat their branch of the question.
test2024,if it have been necessary we are prepared to take certain steps to conciliate the shrinking.
test2025,our movement is for all it would also be the most delicate ladies.
test2026, raise the standard among them and bring me your thousand names.
test2027,a look after the details as well as the book currents missus farron added in a tone as explainable as could be expected of such a woman and with a smile of which the sweetness was
test2028,said ollie chancellor with a face which seemed to plead for a removal of responsibility.
test2029,i want to be near them to help them.
test2030,it was one thing to choose for herself but now the great representative of the enrichment of their sex from every form of bandage had chosen for her
test2031,the unhappiness of women
test2032,they were her sisters they were her own and the day of her delivery had dawned.
test2033,this was the only sacred cause this was the great the dust revolution it was triumph. it was sweep everything before it it must exact from the other the brutal blood stained ravening race the last
test2034,"there would be names of women weak, insulted, persecuted but devoted in every parts of their being to the cause and asking no better fate than to die for it."
test2035,it was not clear to this interesting girl in what manner such a sacrifice at this last would be required of her that she saved a matter through a kind of suny wind of emotion which made danger as
test2036,when miss bird's eye approached it transformed her familiar her comic shape and made the little little humanitarian hack seem already a mother.
test2037,ollie chancellor looked at her with love remember that she had never in her long and rewarded wary life had a thought of an impulse for herself.
test2038,she had been consumed by the passion of sympathy it had crumpled her into as many creaks as an old glazed disended glove.
test2039,"but excuse me, didn't you figure on doing some detecting and giving up fishing?"
test2040,"and shag, with the freedom of an old servant stood looking at his master as if not quite understanding the new twist the affairs had taken."
test2041,"i'm going off fishing, i may not catch anything and may not want to after i get there."
test2042,"get ready, shag yes yes, colonel."
test2043,and having put himself in a fair way as he had hoped to solve some of the problems connected with the darsy case captain ashley went down to police headquarters to learn more facts in the connection
test2044,"pincus and donovan haven't they, carl yeah."
test2045,kellie was too much engaged in watching the blue wind curl lassily upward from his cigar just then to say more.
test2046,"are you going to work on that case, chief?"
test2047,"but he hadn't any more to do with it, commander, that cat."
test2048,"perhaps not, admitted commander ashley."
test2049,we've got our man and that's all we want.
test2050,you're on that darsy case they tell me in a way yes.
test2051,i'm working in the interest of the young men.
test2052,it's just one of them coincidence's like.
test2053,busted his head in with a heavy candlestick one of a pair.
test2054,"gad, explained the colonel."
test2055,the very pair i was going to buy.
test2056,"look here, captain do you know anything about this?"
test2057,and the detective's professional instincts got the upper hand of his friendship not the least in the world not as much as you do was the cool answer
test2058,i happened to see those candlesticks in the window of single futt's shop the other day and i may have had my mind to buy them when i had a chance.
test2059,now i'm afraid i won't but how did it happen?
test2060,"but i don't know whether that's his first or his last name, anyway, he had a partner name share lee."
test2061,"anyway, he and fitt didn't go along very well, it seems."
test2062,ne neighbors often heard him sounds a lot and this afternoon they went at it again and hot and heavy.
test2063,to dark a man went into a lamp.
test2064,he found the place without a light in it stumbled over something on the floor and there was alie's body with his head smashed in in this heavy candlestick near it.
test2065," sure, held so tight we could get it out."
test2066,maybe the fight was about who owned the watch for the daggs talked in their foreign language and none of the neighbors could tell what they were saying i see.
test2067,and the watch have you it yes it's here.
test2068,"that's the watch, announced the headquarters detective reaching in for it going in, see."
test2069,you're not as screaming as all that are you? just because it was in a dead man's hands and a woman's?
test2070,and donaldson's voice was plain skeptical.
test2071,"yes, it may have some rough edges on it."
test2072,and i've read enough about herbs to know the danger i'd advise you to be careful.
test2073,if you don't mind i should like to examine this a bit.
test2074,"before the big wind in irland suggested thong, with the nod of the irish companion slightly, he'll have the colonel,"
test2075,"that's right, agreed the commander as he continued to move his magnifying glass over the surface of the still ticking watch."
test2076,and a close observer might have observed that he did not touch his bare hands to the time piece but poked it about and touched it here and there with the end of a led pencil.
test2077,"and daniel, take a friend's advice and don't be too free by that watch too free with it. too free with it."
test2078,ask the surprise detective yes.
test2079,don't scratch yourself on whatever you do why not?
test2080," simply because this watch,"
test2081,someone out here to see you.
test2082,"all right, there be in a second."
test2083,shingfeet was the painting answer.
test2084,"i want to talk over darsy's case with you, the commander had said and the two had talked, had thought, had talked again and now we were silent for a time."
test2085,what are the chances of getting him off legally if we go at it from a negative perspective? asked the colonel.
test2086,"rather a hypothetical question, college but i should say it might be a fifty fifty proposal."
test2087,at best he would get off with a scotch verdict of not proven but he doesn't want that nor do i.
test2088,and you i don't want it either.
test2089,but i want to know just where we stand now i know.
test2090,but i need to do a little more smoking out first now i wanted to think.
test2091,if you excuse me i'll pretend i'm fishing and i may catch something.
test2092,in fact i have a feeling that i will land my fish.
test2093,"i'd recommend him to you instead of blackstone. thanks, kenny."
test2094,what is it? perhaps i can help you.
test2095,"the old adage of two heads, you know."
test2096,"yes, it still holds good."
test2097,"no alamony, replied the colonel, puzzled. yes, just that."
test2098,and there's no reason you should know.
test2099,chuckled the colonel as he skillfully played the luckless trout now struggling to get loose from the hook.
test2100,and when the fish was landed panning on the grass and shag had been roused from his slumber to slip the now limp fish into the creek captain ashley gave a
test2101,the reason she asked no alamia asked kenny.
test2102,no i wasn't thinking of that.
test2103,"however, don't think i'm not interested in your case i've finished enough for today."
test2104,"well, i don't know that you can."
test2105,"it isn't generally known when the lawyer that the hotel keeper's wife has left him,"
test2106,it was one of what at first might be called refined cruelty on her husband's part degrading gradually into that of a baster's sort.
test2107,you don't mean that large struck her that there was physical abuse do you? asked the colonel that's what he did.
test2108,the commander did not disclose the fact that it was no news to him.
test2109,eran graffin's statement was being unexpectedly confirmed.
test2110,he remembered that cynthia and graham had once been in love with each other.
test2111,she said he had struck her more than once and she could stand it no longer.
test2112,because large made a defense.
test2113,"larch, by refusing to appear practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation."
test2114,so i had to let her have her way and we did not ask the court for money though i had no such squeaky feelings when it came to my counsel fee.
test2115,"no, but he will or i will sue him and get judgment oh he'll pay all right."
test2116,and it takes all sorts of people to make it up.
test2117,still i would like to know.
test2118,the murder of missus darsy had some time ago been shifted off the front page though it would get back there when the young jewel was tried.
test2119,"it had a double reputation, so to speak."
test2120,"gave grave and even reverent the conventions assembled in its ballroom and politicians of the upper, if not better class, were frequently seen in its dining room or cafe."
test2121,lars himself was a peculiar character.
test2122,in a smaller place he would have been called a salon keeper.
test2123,"and it was this man, rich, it was said handsome certainly that cynthia rathwell had married,"
test2124,to this was the answer whispered money.
test2125,and in a way it was true.
test2126,she also saw an opportunity of paying old debts and reaping some rewards.
test2127,after the marriage which was a brilliant and gay male if not happy the large hotel it could hardly be called a home became the scene of many festive occasions
test2128,then it was said of large that soon after the echoes of the wedding chimes had died away he had begun to treat his wife with refined cruelty that hidden away from the public beneath his habitual manner there
test2129,but it was noticed that the older and more conservative families were less often represented and when they were it was by some of the younger members who's reputation were already smarted or who had not yet
test2130,"it wouldn't do, you know after that story came out for me and the vice chancellor who sat in the case as well as other judges and members of the bar to be seen there kenny explained"
test2131," meanwhile, captain alesse was a very busy man and to no one did he tell much about his activities he did darsie frequently at the jail and to that young man's pleading that something"
test2132,don't worry it will come out all right.
test2133,i'm going to rectify them but it will take time.
test2134,"it's hard for miss mason too, though she is bearing up like a major."
test2135,"so king god bail who put it up,"
test2136,it was high large
test2137,they took hary away a week ago.
test2138,but his is a pretty unshaded shoes to be in just the same.
test2139,only that i darsy hesitated and grew red.
test2140,"good evening, commander. he called gellie. will you join me in a western rabbit?"
test2141,"thank you, no."
test2142,i'm afraid my digestion is not quite up to that as have i had to cut out my fishing of late.
test2143,"now as to certain matters in the store on the morning of the murder,"
test2144,the stopped clocks for example have you any theory?
test2145,there were three of them the center figure being that of harry king and he was very much intoxicated.
test2146,"that is not always, but sometimes it happened to be so now."
test2147,"i beg your pardon, he said in the cultural tones he knew so well how to use yet of which he made so little use of late."
test2148,i said where have you been? remarked the other. we've missed you.
test2149,"i said i was golfing, he went on exceedingly distinctly though with an effort."
test2150,"why polonia, someone asked."
test2151,because dear friend replied king softly he somewhat resembles a certain person here who talks too much but who is not so wise as he thinks
test2152,there was a rattle of coins on the mahogany bar. king sought to disentangle a single bill from the watted currency in his pocket.
test2153,it's it's an odd coin an old roman one that missus darsy had in its inner private collection kept in the jewelry store safe was the whispered answer.
test2154,i went over them the day and noticed some were missing though i saw them all when i paid a visit to her just a short time before she was killed.

test2257,"he exclaimed, won't go?"
test2258,he says he never has left prison without a breastband to play him out and he is not going to go without one now
test2259,said the prime minister we can hardly be supposed to supply a release prisoner with a brass band how on earth would we defend it on the estimates
test2260,anyway he won't go unless he has a pant.

test2294,in the drawing room after dinner their nervousness and awkwardness increased.
test2295,oh we haven't shown you the silver wedding present said mrs. peters suddenly as those struck by a brilliant idea for entertaining the guest here they all are
test2296, such nice useful gifts a few duplicated of course.
test2297,seven cream jugs put in peter
test2298,we feel that we must live on cream for the rest of our lives.
test2299,of course some of them can be changed.
test2300,i put it down by the clary jug said william feid busy with another object
test2301,vigilance was not completely crowned with a sense of victory.
test2302,after they had had said good night to their visitor missus peter expressed her conviction that he had taken something
test2303,how on earth are we to know said peter the mean pig hasn't brought us a present and i'm hanging if he shall carry one off
test2304,is the only thing to do.
test2305,william was late in coming down to breakfast and his manner showed plainly that something was a miss.
test2306,it's an un pleasant thing to have to say he blurted out presently but i'm afraid you must have a thief among your servants something's been taken out of my porton toe
test2307,it was a little present from my mother and myself for your silver wedding.

test2310,lady ernestine pigeon coat his mother moved in circles which were entirely beyond their compas or ambitions and the son would probably one day be an ambassador.
test2311, husband and wife looked blankly and desperately at one another.
test2312,it was missus peter who arrived first at an inspiration how dreadful to think there are thieves in the house we keep a drawing room locked up at night of course but anything might be carried off while we
test2313,she rose and went out hurriedly as though to assure herself that the drawing room was not being stripped of its silverwear and returned a moment later bearing a cream jug in her hands
test2314,the pigeon and coats had turned pale than ever missus peter had a final inspiration.
test2315,peter dashed out of the room with glad relief he had lived so long during the last few minutes that a golden wedding seemed with within measureable distance
test2316,missus peter turned to her guest with confident coinage.
test2317,peter's little weakness it transends in the family good lord
test2318,do you mean to say he is an accephalman like cousin snacker?
test2319,brave little woman said beeter with a gasp of relief i could never have done it
test2320,i'm from the cutter lying off the coast.
test2321,we don't cry he said i was obliged to come
test2322,and and you have not found out anything came in quick frightened tones
test2323,i would wish you to believe me that i am in as great trouble about it as you are
test2324,"that my father, sr. rishir graham has smugged goods here"
test2325,he could not help it he hates the smugglers you shall not tell
test2326,pray pray say you will not archar is silent
test2327,then as arches stood in the dark literally as agas with astonishment he heard the faint rustling once more and again all was silent
test2328,he laughed but it was a curious kind of laugh full of vexation injured love love of our own love of our own dignity of which aracar ray stroke in the full flush of his
test2329,and all comes of dressing up in this stupid way like a rough fisher lad
test2330,water cold came on this idea directly as he recalled the fact that the darkness was intense and celia could not have seen him
test2331,i'll soon show them that i am not going to be played with.
test2332,for suddenly occurred to him that he was not only a prisoner but a prisoner in the power of a very reckless set of people who would stop it nothing
test2333,no he thought to himself i don't believe they would kill me but they would knock me about.
test2334,the kick he had received was a foretaste of what he might expect and after a little consideration he came to the conclusion that his duty was to escape and get back to the cutter as quickly as
test2335,to do this he must scheme lie hid until a morning then make for the nearest point in signal for help unless a boat's crew were already searching for him how to escape
test2336,the window was barred but he went to it and tried the bars one by one to find them all solidly fitted into the stone silt.
test2337,next next as he felt his way about his hand touched an old marble marble piece fireplace chimney
test2338,yes if other ways failed he could escape up the chimney
test2339,no that was too bad he could not do that.
test2340,sympathy and pity for the dwellers in the hoes was completely gone now and he said his teeth fast and mentally called himself a weak idiot for ever thinking about such people
test2341,a narrow table in the wall in two places
test2342,"he went and tried to force his head through, recalling as he did as where a person's head would go the rest of the body would pass"
test2343,but there was no chance for his body that the head would not go first.
test2344,a fellow who was shut up in prison for life might do it he said but not in a case like this
test2345, sure you've looked around everywhere boy yes father quat
test2346,i'm going home to breakfast.
test2347, shall i come to him father no
test2348,stop here until sir risser comes down and tell him i'm very sorry that we should have cleared out last night only a born fool saw jerry andandy's boat coming into the cove and
test2349,tell him not to be easy it's all right and i'll have everything clear away to night
test2350,the dull sound of departing steps and a low whistling sound coming down through the skylight window into the cabin where archy ray lay with his heavy eyes pressed down by sleep
test2351,what a queer dream he thought to himself
test2352,but queer for mr. mister to be talking like that to andrew teel the boy who helped the cook
test2353,and why did andy call mister father
test2354,there was an interval of thinking over this nitty question during which the low noise went on
test2355,and i'm hungry too time i was up i'm up.
test2356,no he was not dreaming for he was looking out on the sea which over which a faint mist hung with reeds of smoke
test2357,what did they say false alarm tell servants and they would clear all away to night see if anything had been left about lobster boat
test2358,once out of that room he could run and by day light the smuggler do not hunt him down
test2359,oh those bars he mentally exclaimed and he was advancing towards them when just as he drew near there was a rustling noise under the window a couple of hands seized the bars there was a scratching of boots
test2360,rama was the first to recover from his surprise.
test2361,"hello, he said who were you?"
test2362,go around and open the door i was shut in my night by mistake
test2363,i saw you last night and wondered who's boy you was
test2364,it was you father picked for shirking and my well i hardly knew you
test2365,nonsense.
test2366,"don't do, sit down, ringing."
test2367,"i think i don't know you, mr. orris."
test2368,will don't do it quickly i know you
test2369," been playing the spy, that's what you've been doing who locked you in"
test2370,arts stepped back to the door listening but there was not a sound
test2371,he has gone to give the alarm said the prisoner and he looked excited around for a way of escape
test2372,but nothing but the chimney presented itself
test2373,a happy inspiration had come and placing one hand on his chest he thrust in the other gave a tug and drew out his little curved dirk gazed at the edge ranted to the window and
test2374,he divided the paint and produced a few quakes and grading sounds as he realized the attempt was madness
test2375,the result was not very satisfying but sufficient so to make him essay the bar of the window once more producing a grade of era selling sound as he found that now he did make a little little so much
test2376,but at the end of five minutes he stopped and thrust back the dirk into its sheath
test2377,no i can't part with that hah hah left the boyies late.
test2378,but i'll yes i'll give you a ginnies if you will let me out.
test2379,ginny's boy think i'll do it for her ginnies well then too
test2380,"be quick, there's a good fellow. i want to get away at once"
test2381,"not you, only a sham."
test2382,why your clothes don't fit you and your caps put on all scruo
test2383,never mind about that let me out of this place
test2384,i told you a fisherman cried archy impatiently but trying not to offend his visitor who possessed the power of conferring freedom by speaking sharply
test2385,not you look like a wild beast in a cage with a monkey you insolent
test2386,archie checked himself and the boy laughed.
test2387,it was your turn yesterday it's my day today what a game
test2388,you laughed and flared at me when i was on the cutting deck.
test2389,i say you do look like a ramon just like a big monkey in a show.
test2390,ram showed his white teeth as he burst out with a long low fit of laughter
test2391,"you rope me, he said."
test2392,why i could tie you up in a knot you could heave you up on the cliff any day what a game
test2393,bit of a midi fed on saltack and wellies biscuit talk of giving me ropes end
test2394,once more will you come and let me out no
test2395,to his astonishment the board had not flunked but thrusted his own arms through placing them about the mida's waist clenching his hand behind and uttering a sharp whistle
test2396,"seemed good enough spires last night, mr. gurg, hey."
test2397,"yes, sir, but he can turn on the cliff on the cliff at any moment."
test2398,"yes, been quite ready yes sir."
test2399,"that's right, of course, well armed."
test2400,as soon as the signal comes we shall push off.
test2401,"an awkward bit of country, sir, six miles before you can find a place to land."
test2402,"so shall we say, sir?"
test2403,you don't think mr. gerry that they would dare to injury him if he was so lucky as to be caught.
test2404,"well, sir, said the master hesitating smugles and smugles."
test2405, certainly sir smugglers are smugglers indeed.
test2406,"please thank me, sir, didn't mean any harm."
test2407,i'm getting very anxious about mr. rieze start at once sir
test2408,no wait another half hour.
test2409,very advised thing to do.
test2410,but i must request that you will not make it again very true.
test2411,"awarded, mr. gurg, awarded."
test2412,"yes, sir, of course."
test2413,"says awkward in the future, not awkward."
test2414,"i mean all alone by myself, sir."
test2415,what four aren't a public house for ten miles didn't mean that
test2416,then what did you mean speak out and don't do the double shuffle all over my clean deck no sir.
test2417,hopping about like a cat on hot bricks.
test2418,now then why do you want to shore?
test2419,"big pardon didn't mean no, sir, so the touchings of his forelough."
test2420,"yes, said sir, the manly happy shall i have at one sir."
test2421,no wait.
test2422,keep a sharp look on the cliff to the cliff if it's if you're raye's ride is signs for a boat.
test2423,he swam round walked off and began swimming the shore again with his master in the deck exchange looks which made a great deal
test2424,that last the little lieutenant could bear the anxiety no longer
test2425,"pip them away into that boat, he said, and he said as the crew sprang in,"
test2426,now mr. gurg said i'm only going to say one thing to you in the way of instructions yes sir
test2427,"beg pardon, said the master deprecatingly."
test2428,"steady, my lads, steady, cried the master keep stroke and then he began to make plans as to his first procedures on as his first procedures on being getting shore."
test2429,"say mr. gurk, said dick after one of these searches he wouldn't run away what?"
test2430,"mr. rye-ston, sir, don't be a fool."
test2431,what tracked your mouth under?
test2432,gurg looked around to see if the men were looking and then said whether hushusus bickley.
test2433,"ah, hederic, dad, sadly."
test2434,say mr. gurser which thank you i am for you for speaking so but you don't really think he has come to harm
test2435,"i hope not, dick i hope not, but smugles don't stand at anything sometimes."
test2436,i do assure you there's nothing here here what you may see.
test2437,"if you let me finish you would know, said roughly one of our boys is missing seeing them up here."
test2438,"boy about seventeen with the cap no sir, indeed, have you not?"
test2439,"don't know as he's been seen about here, do you? do you say, looking at her searching? no sir."
test2440,if she evil had come to the poor lad her face would tell tales of print.
test2441,"i said a said about seventeen and a red cap like yours, said very quickly."
test2442,the man stood his head and stared as if he didn't half understand the drift of what was said.
test2443,"here, my lad, where's your master?"
test2444,"well i say, what's your master?"
test2445,guer turned away patiently again and signing to his men to follow they all began to tramp the steep track leading towards the hose with the rabbit scuttling away among the furs and showing
test2446,i don't know i'm out of dick and the men can't be sure.
test2447,gurled and stated his business while the baron who had turned sallier and more care for his heart did a breath of full relief one of your ship boys he said

test2552,sheriff glisson of watonville county who was taking bob's pistol from him was also shouting to the fellow.
test2553,including those received in and on the way from northfield i had eleven wounds.
test2554,and sheriff glisling's order not to shoot was the beginning of the protector that minnesota people established over us
test2555,captain mordock
test2556,but marisport had flourished enough to kill it off.
test2557,some of mars laws dated from the time when law enforcement had been hampered by lack of men rather than by the type of men
test2558,the stone wall network had perhaps five hundred
test2559,even deleron and failures had to eat there were stories and shops throughout the district which eeked out some kind of a marginal living
test2560,they were safe from protection rackeries there none bothered to come so far out.
test2561,the shopkeepers and some of the less unfortunate people there had protested loud enough to reach clear back to earth
test2562,captain mordoc was an unknown factor and now was asking for more men.
test2563,the pressure was enough to get them for him.
test2564,gordon reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out mixed with a vague relief.
test2565,i've got a free hand and we're going to run this way we would on earth.
test2566,your job is to protect the citizens here and that means everyone not breaking the laws whether you feel like it or not no graft
test2567,the first man making a shake-down will get the same treatment we're going to use on the stone wall boys you'll get double pay here and you can live on it
test2568,he picked out five of the men including gordon you five will come with me
test2569,the rest of you can team up any way you want to tonight pick any route that's open okay men let's go
test2570,bruce gordon grins slowly as he swung the stick and mordoc's eyes fell on him earth cop
test2571,"two years, gordon admitted."
test2572,for a second gordon cursed himself
test2573,he began wondering about security then
test2574, nobody had tried to get in with him.
test2575,there was a crude lighting system here put up by the citizens at the front of each each building a dim phosphor bulb glowed when darkness fell they would have nothing else to see by
test2576,moving in two groups of three at opposite sides of the street they began their beat
test2577,there was no chance to save the citizen who was dying from lack of air.
test2578,gordon felt the solid pleasure of the finally turned club in his hands.
test2579,gordon's eyes popped at that.
test2580,he swallowed the sentiment his own club was moving now
test2581,the other four cops had come in reluctantly.
test2582,he brought him to the ground with a single blow across the kidneys.
test2583,they rounded up the men of the gang and one of the cops started off.
test2584,to find a phone and call the wagon.
test2585,"we're not using wagons, mordred told him line them up."
test2586,if they tried to run they were hit from behind if they stood still they were clad carefully
test2587,mordur indicated one who stood with his shoulder shaking and tears running down his cheeks.
test2588,the captain's face was as sick as gordon's felt
test2589,i want the name of every man in the gang you can remember he told the man.
test2590,colonel they'd kill me i don't know
test2591,mordard took his nod as evidence enough and turned to the wicked tuffs
test2592,if he should turn up dead i'll know you boys are responsible and i'll find you
test2593,"the beginning brewing shortly after, though."
test2594,mordard sent one of the men to pick up a second squad of six and then a third
test2595,and the third one bruce gordon spotted one of the men who had been before.
test2596,get a stretcher and take him wherever he belongs he ordered
test2597,but the captain stirred finally sighing
test2598,no the cops are giving me we're covered gordon
test2599,but the stone wall gang is backing wane.
test2600,but it's going to be tough on them.
test2601,bruce gardner grimsmerson i've got a yellow ticket from security
test2602,mardok blinks he dropped his eye slowly
test2603,what makes you think wain will be re-reduced?
test2604, nobody wants him except a group of crooks and those in power.
test2605,ever see a maritan election
test2606,no you're a firsters he can't lose
test2607,and then hell is going to pop and this whole planet may be blown white open.
test2608,it fitted with the dier predictions of security and what the spying gordon was going to do according to them.
test2609,he was getting even fattier now that he was being eating better food from the fair restaurant around the corner.
test2610,cost a more but they'd be respectable
test2611,because isy is always honest according to how he sees it
test2612,but you got earth ideas of the stuff like i had once
test2613,the groups grew more experienced and mordur was training a new squad every night.
test2614,it wasn't exactly legal but nothing was here
test2615,this could lead to abuses as he'd seen on earth.
test2616,but there probably wouldn't be time for it if mayor wain was re elected.
test2617,it was night outside and the phosphate bulbs at the corners glowed dimly giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the externized precinct house
test2618,it had probably been years since any had dared risk it after the sun went down.
test2619,and the slow doubtful respect on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that haley's system was working
test2620,gordon hit the signal switch and the marshes speaker let out a shriek.
test2621,gun suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere
test2622,"you can't do it to me,"
test2623,i'm reformed i'm going straight.
test2624,you dammed cops can't oneo was blubbering.
test2625,one look was enough the work papers had the teltail over thickening of the signature that had shown up on other papers obviously ferries
test2626,some turned away as gordon and the other cop went to work but most of them weren't squeakish
test2627,when it was over the two picked up their wimpers and captive
test2628,jenkins the other cop had been holding the wallet
test2629,must have been making a big contact in something fifty fifty
test2630,there must have been over two thousand credits in the wallet
test2631,when gordon and jennings came back mordoc tossed the money to them split it
test2632,"whatever comes to hand, governor,"
test2633,"like the social call, gordon asked him."
test2634,the little man shook his head his ancient eighteen year old face turning sober no
test2635,you earn me some bills governor
test2636,eleven hundred fifty credits
test2637,you didn't pay up your pledge to the captain fund so i had to fill in
test2638,a thousand interest at ten percent a week standard right.
test2639,gordon had heard of the friendly interest charged on the side here but he shook his head wrong as he
test2640,"hah, is he turned it over and shook his head."
test2641,now show me where i signed any agreement saying i'd pay you back.
test2642,for a second isy's face went blank then he chuckled
test2643,he pulled out the bills and handed them over.
test2644,"thanks, izzy thank you yourself"
test2645,the kid pocketed the money cheerfully nodding
test2646,the little guy knew mars as many others did apparently from all sides
test2647,and if any of the other guys had private racks of their own isy was undoubtedly the man to find it out and use the information with a beat such as that even going halfs and with all
test2648,the captain look completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped into the bench.
test2649,"go on, accept damm."
test2650,there was a man coming from earth on a second ship who would see him
test2651,the little publisher was back at the crusader again.
test2652,only gordon and shela were left.
test2653,credit had been established again and the businesses were open
test2654,gordon came to a row of temporary bubbles individual dwellings built like the dome but opaque for privacy
test2655,they had been lucky.
test2656,shulman's volunteers were official now.
test2657,fat's place was still open though the crooked tables had been removed gordon dropped to a stool slipping off his helmet
test2658,he reached automatically for the glass of ether needled beer.
test2659,thought you'd be in the chips.
test2660,that's mars gordon echoed the other's comment why don't you pull off the planet fats you could go back to earth i'd guess the other nodded
test2661,just a man gets used to anything hell maybe i can hire some bums to sit around and wop it up when the ships come in and bill this as a real old maritan den of sin
test2662,there was a grin on the other's face.
test2663,finally got our orders for you it's mercury
test2664,we sent twenty others the same way and they failed
test2665,let's say you've shifted some of the misery around a bit and giving them a chance to do better.

test2667,there's a rocket waiting to trans ship you to the moon on the way to mercury right now gordon side
test2668,and i paid her the pay we owe you from the time you began using your badge she's out shopping

test2671,"i i i oh drad, i'm getting old, isy, you tell him."
test2672,he grabbed gordon's hand and waddled down the landing plank iis shook his head
test2673,any custer had begun to make makes with lizzy.
test2674,lesley determined to try for honors in english language and literature
test2675,her tastes all lay in this direction her idea being by and by to follow her mother's profession of journalism for which she already showed considerable aptitude
test2676,she had no idea of allowing herself to break down.

test2705,what can she be doing out by herself?
test2706,leslie left the room but she had gaseous gone a dozen places down the corridor before she met any returning
test2707,anna's eyes were very bright her cheeks were no longer pale and there was a brilliant color in them
test2708,she did not take the least notice of leslie but going into the room shut the door.
