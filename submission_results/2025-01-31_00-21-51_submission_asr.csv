test0000,there's iron they say in all our blood and a grain or two perhaps is good but his he makes me harshly feel has got a little too much of steel an on
test0001,margaret said mister hale as he returned from showing his guests downstairs i could not help watching your face with some anxiety when mister thorne made his confession of having been a shop boy
test0002,you don't mean that you thought me so silly
test0003,i really like that account of himself better than anything else he said
test0004,his statement of having been a shop boy was the thing i like best of all
test0005,you were who were always accusing people of being shappy at hilton
test0006,i don't think mister hale you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been
test0007,i really was very much afraid of showing him how much shock i was at some parts of what he said
test0008,his father dying in miserable circumstances
test0009,why it might have been in the workhouse
test0010,his father speculated widely failed and then killed himself because he could not bear the disgrace
test0011,all his former friends shrunk from the disclosures that had to be made of his dishonest gambling wild hopeless struggles made with other people's money to regain his own moderate portion of wealth
test0012,no one came forward to help the mother and this boy
test0013,at least no friend came forward immediately and miss thonan is not one i fancy to wait until tardy kindness comes to find her out
test0014,so they were leftton
test0015,how tanned asked father
test0016,oh papa by that testing everything by the standard of wealth
test0017,when he spoke of the mechanical powers he clearly looked upon them only as new ways of extending trade and making money
test0018,and the poor men around him they were poor because they were vicious out of the pale of his sympathy because they had not his his nature and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich
test0019,not violent he never said that
test0020,in providence and self-indulent were his words
test0021,margaret was collecting her mother's working materials and preparing to go to bed
test0022,just as she was leaving the room she hesitated she was inclined to make an acknowledgement which she thought would please her father but which to be full and true must include a little annoyance
test0023,however out it came
test0024,papa i do think mister thorne a very remarkable man but personally i don't like him at all
test0025,and i do said her father laughing
test0026,personally as you call it and all
test0027,i don't set him up for a hero or any of that kind
test0028,"but good night, child"
test0029,there were several other signs of something wrong about missus hale
test0030,she and dickson held mysterious consultations in a bedroom from which dickson would come out crying and cross as was a custom when any distress of her mistress called up on her sympathy
test0031,once margaret had gone into the chamber soon after dixon left it and found her mother on her knees and as margaret stole out she caught a few words which were undoubtedly a prayer for strength and patience to induce severe bodily suffering
test0032,but though she received cures and fine words back again in such profusion as would have glad in her formally yet she felt that there was a secret withheld from her and she believed it brought serious reference to her mother's health
test0033,she lay awake very long this night planning how to lessen the evil influence of her milton life on her mother
test0034,a servant to dickson permanent assistance should be got if she gave up the whole time to the search and then at any rate her mother might have all the personal attention she required and had been accustomed to her whole life
test0035,visiting register offices seeing all manner of unlikely people and very few in the least likely absorb margaret's time and thoughts for several days
test0036,one afternoon she met bessy hikings in the street and stopped to speak to her
test0037,"well bissy, how are you?"
test0038,better and not better if you know what that means
test0039,not exactly replied margaret smiling
test0040,i'm better than not being torn to pieces by coughing nights but i'm weary and tired of milton and longing to get away to the land of bula and when i think i'm far and far farther off my heart sinks and i'm not better i'm worse
test0041,margaret turned around to walk along alongside of the girl in her weak progress home.
test0042,but for a mineral or two she did not speak
test0043,at last she said in a low voice
test0044,bessy do you wish to die?
test0045,bessy was silent in her turn for a minute or two then she replied
test0046,not worse than many others i reckon
test0047,but what was it?
test0048,you know i'm a stranger here so perhaps i'm not so quick at understanding what you mean as if i'd lived all my life in milton
test0049,i had forgotten what i said for the time continued margaret quietly
test0050,i should have thought of it again when i was less busy may i go with you now
test0051,the sharpness in her eye turned to a whistling longing as she met margaret soft and friendly gaze
test0052,as they turned up into a small court opening out into a scolded street bessy said
test0053,you'll not be daunted at your fathers at home and speaks a bit gruffy at first
test0054,it was not at home when they entered
test0055,gassy at last
test0056,bessy took a long and feverish draft and then fell back and shut her eyes
test0057,margaret bent over and said bessy don't be in patience with your life whatever it is or may have been
test0058,remember who gave it to you and made it what it is
test0059,now i'll not have my wench speak too
test0060,but surely said margaret facing round you believe in what i said that god gave her life and ordered what kind of life it was to be
test0061,i believe what i see and no more
test0062,"that's what i believe, young woman"
test0063,i don't believe all i hear no not by big deal
test0064,but who's come at last and who's welcome as long as he'll keep from preaching on what who knows not about
test0065,it's simple and not far to fetch nor hard to work
test0066,but the girl only played the more with margaret
test0067,don't think hard on him he is a good man he is
test0068,i sometimes think i shall be marked with sorrow even in the city of god your father is not there
test0069,the feverous color came into a chicks and the feverous flame into her eye
test0070,but you'll be there father you shall oh my heart
test0071,she put her aunt to it and became gastly pale
test0072,margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to rest upon her bosom
test0073,presently the spasm that forecasted death had passed away and bessy roused herself and said
test0074,i'll go to bed it's its best place but catching at margaret's gown you'll come again i know you will but just say it
test0075,"i will come to tomorrow, said margaret"
test0076,margaret went away very sad and thoughtful
test0077,she was late for tea at home
test0078,"have you met with a servant, dear?"
test0079,no mama that anne buckling would never have been done
test0080,s suppose i try said mister hell
test0081,everybody else has had their turn at this great difficulty now let me try
test0082,i may be the cinderella to put on the slipper after all
test0083,what would you do papa how would you say about it
test0084,well i i would apply it to some good house mother to recommend me one known to herself or her servants
test0085,very good but we must first catch our house mother
test0086,the mother of whom he spoke to us said margaret
test0087,mister thonton the only mother he has i believe said helle quietly
test0088,i shall like to see her she must be an common person her mother added
test0089, perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us and be glad of our place
test0090,she sounded to be such a careful economic person that i should like any one out of the same family
test0091,"my dear, said mister hell alarm, pray don't go off on that idea."
test0092,i'm sure at any rate she would not like strangers to know anything about it
test0093,take notice that this is not my kind of hortons papa if i have any at all which i don't agree to but you are always accusing me of it
test0094,i don't know positively that it is her either but from little things i have gathered from him i fancy so
test0095,they cared too little to ask in what manner her son had spoken about her

test0210,what's that there is siddie
test0211,replied he of a truth i heard him not and i want him not and folks are all sleeping
test0212,but she said whom ever thou seest awake he is the singer

test0214,rejoined the unnik who then was the reciter point him out to me
test0215,"by ala, replied the fireman i tell you the truth"
test0216,tell me what happened what is your aamak?
test0217,what ales did then that you do need to read verses seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the folks are asleep for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue
test0218,and he also improvised the two following this stitch
test0219,when you didn't alas alamman heard the first improvisation she called to me my father and her mother and her brother and their willow home then she wept and cried to the yoon and said to him woe to thee
test0220,he who recited the first time has recited a second time and i heard him hard by
test0221,by alaah and thou fatch him not to me i will assuredly rouse the chamberland on you and he shall beat you and cast the out
test0222,but take these hundred dinners and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently and do him no hurt
test0223,return quickly and linger not
test0224,when it was the seventy third night
test0225,but the yonks said i will not leave you till you show me who it was that recited the verses for i dread returned to my lady without him
test0226,now when the fireman heard these words he feared for zawal makan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the unit by ala it was not i and i know him not
test0227,so go you to your station and if you again meet any one after this hour singing ot of poetry whether he be near or far it will be i or someone i know and you shall not learn of him but by me
test0228,then he kissed the oonk's head and spake him fair until he went away but the castrota fetched around and returning secretly came and stood behind the fireman fearing to go back to his mistress without tides
test0229,i say what made my ignorance whatever the bitter cup i drain far be from me that i land to flee nor will i bow to those who blame and for such love would deal me shame
test0230,then said the uncle to zawalma be peace with you of my lord
test0231,oh my lord continued the unak and sharad had perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
test0232,we will do you no up right of my son not wrong you not in it but our object is that you band your grateful steps with me to my mistress to receive her answer and returning wheel and safety and you shall have a handsome present as one who brings good news
test0233,then the yukon went out to zao walman and said to him read what verses you know you for my ladies here hard by listening to you and after i will ask you of your name and your native country and your condition
test0234,and also these
test0235,then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his boson and the twain fell down in a fainting fit
test0236,when the yonks saw his case he wondered at them and throwing over them some somewhat to cover them waited until they should recover
test0237,after a while they came to themselves and uas alasman rejoiced with exceeding joy oppression and depression left her laughter and happiness took the mastery of her and she repeated these verses
test0238,accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the kan and what had happened to her with the badawy how the merchant had bought her of him and had taken her to her brother sharak and had sold her to him how he had freed her at the time of buying him how he had made her a marriage contract with her and had taken her to her brother sharak and had made her a marriage contract with her and had taken her to her brother sharak and had made her a marriage contract with her and had taken her to her brother sharak and had made her a marriage contract with her and had taken her to her brother sharak and had made her a marriage contract with her and had taken her to her brother sharak and had made her a marriage contract with her and had taken her to her brother sharak and had made her a marriage contract with her and had taken her to her brother sharak and
test0239,but now go to thy master and bring him quickly to me
test0240,the chamberlet called the castrota and charged him to do accordingly so he replied i hear and i obey and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the stalkers until he found him in the rear of the carman gering his ass and preparing for flight
test0241,she said it has reached me oh esteemed king that when the staker gurted his head for flight and bebeed himself saying oh would i know what he has become of him
test0242,i believe he has denounced me to the yukon hence these pages at about me and he has made me an companion in his crime
test0243,why did you say i never repeated these couplets nor do i know who repeated them when it was your companion
test0244,but now i will not leave thee between this place and bagdad and what bethedth thou thy companion shall be thine
test0245,it was as i feared the coming ill's discerning but on to ala we are all returning
test0246,then the unkeon cried upon his pages saying take him off the ass
test0247,and he answered i am the chamberland of the emir of damascus king sharak song of omar bina nal numum lord of agadah and of the land of corasan and i bring tribute and presents from him to his father in agadah
test0248,so faire forward's no harm shall be before you until you join his grand wazier than done
test0249,then he bid him be seated and questioned him and he replied that he was chamberling to the emperor of damascus and was bound to king amor with presence and the tribute of syria
test0250,so it was a agreement that we go to damas and fetch dence the king's son charkan and make him sultan over his father's realm
test0251,and among them were some who would have chosen the cadet zahm makan for quoth he his name be light of the place and he has a sister nusah al alamah high the delight of the time but they set out five years ago for al jezhah and no one who is become of them
test0252,so he turned to the wizard dandan and said to him verily your tale is a wonder of wonders
test0253,know o chief wizier that here where you have encountered me allah has given you rest from fatigue and brings you your desire after the easiest of styles for that his almighty will restore it to you zayah macan and his sister nusah alazam where we will settle the matter as we easily can
test0254,when the minister heard these words he rejoiced with great joy and said oh chamberlain tell me the tale of the twain and what befelt them and the cause of their long absence
test0255,zawak makan bowed his head a while and then said i accept the position for indeed there was no refusing and he was certified that the chamberlane had cancelled him well and wisely and set him on the right way
test0256,then he added oh my uncle how shall i do with my brother sharkon
test0257,after a while the dust dispersed and air appeared under it the army of bagdad and coraasan a conquering host like the pool tied sea and caraasan a conquering host like the pool tied sea and caraasad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
test0258,when it was a seventy eighth night
test0259,and in it or rejoiced at the ascension of the light of the place
test0260,lastly the minister went in and kissed the ground before zawal alamkan who rose to meet him saying welcome of wazal alamkan who rose to meet him saying welcome of wazal alamkan who rose to meet him saying welcome of wazal alamkan that was welcome of wazal alamkan that was welcome of wazal alamkan that was welcome of wazal alamkan that was a welcome of wazal alamkan that was a welcome of wazal alamkan that was a welcome of wazal alamman that was a welcome of wazal alamman that was a welcome of wazal alamman that was a welcome of wazal alamman that was a welcome of wazal alamman that was a welcome of wazal alamman that was a welcome of wazal alamman that was a welcome of wazal alamman that
test0261,however the sultan commanded his wazir and done call at ten days halt of the army that he may be private with him and learn from him how and where his father had been slain
test0262,he then repaired to the heart of the enclosure and ordered the host to halt ten days
test0263,what has happened to me
test0264,he asked himself something warm and living quickly at me it must be in the neighborhood
test0265,when however the turstas was quite nigh to them then did he hear plainly that human voice speak in the midst of the kind and apparently all of them had turned their heads towards the speaker
test0266,for do i hear seek
test0267,answered he the same that you seekers you mischief maker that is to say happiness upon earth
test0268,for i tell you that i have already talked half a morning to them and just now were they about to give me their answer

test0277,why do you do you do me
test0278,answered the other
test0279,thou knowest it thyself better even than i
test0280,so thus baked the peaceful one and puffed himself and pressied with his words so that the kind kind wondered a new
test0281,you do your violence to yourself you preacher on the mount and you use it such saving words
test0282,they also arose from all heavy thoughts which inflated the heart
test0283,well

test0319,for now everything that is narrow and fixed seduce it and tempted day
test0320,thou has lost your goal
test0321,thou poor rover and rambleth thou tired but fly
test0322,will you have a rest in a home this evening
test0323,once on a time a brama who was walking along the road came upon an iron cage in which a great tiger had been shut up by the villages that caught him
test0324,the brama answered no i will not for if i let you out of the cage you will eat me
test0325,o father of mercy answered the tiger in truth that i will not
test0326,i will never be so ungrateful only let me out that i may drink some water and return
test0327,then the bramman took pity on him and opened the cage door but no sooner had he made it so that the tiger jumping out said now i will eat you first and drink the water afterwards
test0328,so the bramman and the tiger walked on till they came to a abandoned tree and the bramman said to it bramsman said to it bramsman said to it bramsman said to it bramsman said to it bramsman said to it bramsman said to it bramsman was said to it bramsman said to it bramsman was said to it bramsman was said to it
test0329,on what must i give judgment as the abandoned tree
test0330,this tiger said the ramman begged me to let him out of his cage to drink a little water and he promised not to hurt me if i did so but now that i have left him out he wishes to eat me
test0331,it is jealous that he should do so or no
test0332,let the tiger eat the man for men are an ungrateful race
test0333,sir camel sir camel cried the bramman hear and give judgment
test0334,at a little distance they have found a bullock lying by the road side
test0335,is it fair that he should do so or not
test0336,let the tiger eat the man for men have no pity
test0337,three out of the six and given judgment against the bramman but still he did not lose all hope and determine me to as the other three
test0338,on what must i give judgment as the evil
test0339,the brama stated the case and the eagle answered whenever men saw me they tried to shoot me they climbed the rocks and steal away my little ones
test0340,then the tiger began to roar and said judgment of all is against you or bramman
test0341,after this they saw an alliance and the brama related the matter to him hoping for a more favorable verdict
test0342,but the alienation said whenever i put my nose out of the water men terrorized me and try to kill me
test0343,the bramman gave himself up as lost but again he prayed the tiger to have patience and let him ask the opinion of the sixth judge
test0344,now the sixth was the jackhove
test0345,the brama told his story and said to him uncle jacob uncle jacob say what is your judgment
test0346,show me the pace
test0347,when the got there the jack said now broman show me exactly where you stood
test0348,exactly there was it asked to jacob
test0349,exactly here replied to bramman
test0350,where was the tiger then
test0351,why i stood so said the tiger jumping into the cage and my head was on this side
test0352,very good said to jekho but i cannot judge without understanding the whole matter exactly
test0353,shut and bolted said the bramman
test0354,then shut and bolted set the jackhole
test0355,when the bramman had taken this the jackel said oh you wicked and ungrateful tiger
test0356,when a good bramman opened your door is to eat him the only return you would make
test0357,proceed on your journey friend franman
test0358,your road lies that way and mind this
test0359,and thus accomplished he excited the adoration of every silly quack and the envy of every fluttering come but by all young gentlemen and ladies of understanding he was heartily despised as a mere civilized monkey

test0365, every one who is trubber has been found by gemini's path the testimony of the oldest p biblical narratives regarding the solon of the hebrews in egypt is also in perfect accord with the picture with which the contemporary egyptian scriptures give the period
test0366,the absence of detailed reference to the hebrews is therefore perfectly natural
test0367,it seems probable that not all but only part of the tribes which ultimate carolers into the hebrew nation found their way to egypt
test0368,the stories regarding joseph their traditional father efrm and manasia imply that these strong central tribes possibly together with the southern tribes of benjamin and juda were the chief actors in its opening scene in israel's history
test0369,the biblical narratives apparently disagree regarding the duration of the seder in egypt

test0393,the title of his title in the law implies that this priest ministered at some wildland sanctuary
test0394,hoses in the home of the indian priest was brought into direct in constant contact with the jesus worship
test0395,the cruel fate of his people and the painful experience in egypt that had driven him into the wilderness prepared his mind to receive this training
test0396,his quest was for a jets and strong gun able to deliver the oppressed
test0397,the wildness with its slinking foes and the ever present dread of hunger and thirst deepens the sense of need and of dependence upon a power able to guide the debt's needs of man

test0415,proust's in that quarter were users destroyed by the siepe is true but the c s for them far more are innocent than are guilty of any acts of violence
test0416,now there is after the sun that sat the wind fell to in a lot air that just kept stairs on the ship

test0421,i say it sale ho and close abroad
test0422,he was too much of the seaman to require a second look in order to a certain but was to be done
test0423,although they went three feet to two this gave us a moment of breathing time
test0424,as our seats were off off forward and remained so for a few minutes it gave me a leisure to look about
test0425,i soon saw both procs and great enough was i to perceive that they had not approached material near
test0426,mister kite should have been so said in a remark that our movements had been so prompt as to take the rascal as the back
test0427,a prayer for stillness has succeeded
test0428,the prophets did not alter the course but near it fast
test0429,i heard the rattling of the boardings pats too as they were cut a drift from the spankboam and fail upon the decks
test0430,kite went out and returned with three or four mice and as many pipes
test0431,the stillness on rain on both sides was like that of death
test0432,the person behaved beautifully he came around like a tup
test0433,the question was now whether we could pass them or not before they got nearing up to grapple
test0434,the captain behaved perfectly well in its critical instance commanded in a dead silence and the closest its intention to his orders
test0435,now i'm so bored the john's heart
test0436,on our side we gave the gentlemen the four sixes two in the nears and two in the sterns most proa which was still near a cable length of it in
test0437,they were like the ayes of fead in english
test0438,i doubt if we touch the man in the nearspire
test0439,in that state the ship passes ahead all of her canvas is full leaving the proma-motives in her wake
test0440,they swam up in front of shermer's pailings as thick as they could jam together and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise
test0441,some sung out tear down the fence tear down the fence
test0442,the stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable
test0443,sherman run his eye slow along the crowd and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out gaze him but they couldn't drop their eyes and look sneaky
test0444,the average men are cruel
test0445,because they're afraid the man's friends will shoot them in the back in the dark and it's just what they would do
test0446,so they always acquire and then a man goes in the night with a hundred massed cowards at his back and lence the rascal
test0447,you didn't want to come
test0448,but a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness
test0449,now leave and take your half a man with you tossing his gun up up his left arm and cocking it when it says this
test0450,the crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearing off all which way and buck harkens he healed it after them looking tolerable cheap
test0451,you can't be too careful
test0452,they argued and tried to keep him out but he wouldn't listen and a whole show come to a stand still
test0453,and one or two women began to screen
test0454,so then the ring master he made a little speech and said he hope there would not be any disturbance and if the man would promise he would not make any more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse
test0455,it weren't funny to me though i was all of a tramble to see his danger
test0456,and the horse are going like a house of fire too
test0457,he shed him so thick they kind of plugged up the air and all together he shed seventeen suits
test0458,why it was one of his own men
test0459,and but no matter the rest of his outfit it was just wild but it was awful funny
test0460,the people most killed themselves laughing and when the king got done capering and capering off behind the scenes they roared and clapped and stormed and hahah until he come back and done it over again and after that they made him do it again and after that they made him do it again and after that they made him do it another time
test0461,twenty people sings out
test0462,the duke says yes
test0463,everybody sings out sold
test0464,but a big fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts hold on
test0465,just a word gentlemen they stopped to listen
test0466,what we want is to go out of here quiet and talk this show up and sell the rest of the town
test0467,you brought it is the judge is right everybody sings out
test0468,we struck the raft at the same time and in less than two seconds we were gliding downstream all dark and still and edges towards the middle of the river nobody saying a word
test0469,we never showed a light till we was about ten miles below the village
test0470,green horns flat heads
test0471,no i say it doesn't
test0472,well it doesn't because it's in breath i reckon they're all a lot
test0473,well that's what i'm saying all kings are mostly rapsgals as far as i can make out is that so
test0474,and look at charles second and leus fourteen and leus fifteen and james second and edward second and richard third and forty more besides all those saxons and heptarkies that used to rip off so in old times and rays can
test0475,my you are to seeing old henry the eight when he was in bloom he was a bloom
test0476,ring up fair roseman
test0477,well henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country
test0478,suppose he opened his mouth what then
test0479,all i say is kings is kings and you got to make allowances
test0480,take them all around they're a mighty ornery lock it's the way they're raised
test0481,well they all do jim
test0482,now to duke he's a tolerable like the man in some ways
test0483,this one is the middle and hard for a duke
test0484,when i woke up just a day break he was sitting there with his head down between the knees moaning and morning to himself
test0485,it doesn't seem natural but i think it so
test0486,he was often moaning and morning that way nights when he judge i was asleep and saying po little elizabeth
test0487,don't you hear me shut the do.
test0488,i lay i make you mine
test0489,just as loud as i could yell
test0490,which was sound enough judgment but you take the average man and he wouldn't wait for him to how
test0491,the king's duds was all black and he did look real swell and starchy
test0492,why before he looked like the ordinary old rip that ever was but now when he would take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile he looked that grand and good and pious that you'd say he had walked right out of the arch and maybe was old levita's himself
test0493,jim cleaned up the canoe and i got my paddle ready
test0494,where were you bound for young man
test0495,get into a board says the king
test0496,i did so so and then we all three started on again
test0497,the young chap was mighty thank you said it was tough work to toot his baggage such weather
test0498,he asked the king who he was going and the king told him he would come down a river and landed at the other village this morning and now he was going up a mile to see an old friend on a farm up there the young fellow says
test0499,but then i say again no i reckon it isn't him or else he wouldn't be walking up the river you aren't him are you
test0500,no my name is blodging alexander blodging reverend alexander blodging i suppose i must say i am one of the large poor servants
test0501,you see he was pretty old and george's geyers was too young to be much company for him except mary jane the red headed one and so he was kind of lonely as after george and his wife died and didn't seem to care much to live
test0502,too bad too bad he couldn't have lived to see his brother's poor soul
test0503,i'm going in a ship next wednesday for riyah jarene where my uncle is
test0504,but it will be lovely wished i was going
test0505,mary jane's eighteen susans is sixteen and jane's is about fourteen that's the one that gives herself to good works and has a hair lip poor things
test0506,well they could be worse off
test0507,old peter had friends and they aren't going to let them come to no harm
test0508,blame him if he didn't acquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town and all about the wilsens and about peter's business which was a tanner and about georgia's which was a carpenter and about harvies which was a disentering minister and so on and so on then he says
test0509,when they're deep they won't stop for a hell
test0510,was peter wilks well off
test0511,when we struck the boat she was about done loading and pretty soon she got off
test0512,now hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the new carpet bags
test0513,so then they waited for a steam boat
test0514,that the king was calm he says
test0515,they give a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to say would they tell you
test0516,then one of them says kind of soft and gentle
test0517,fellis was one of these little one horse cotton plantations and they all look like
test0518,i went down and climb over the back back by the ash hopper and started for the kitchen
test0519,i out with a yes for i thought
test0520,so then she started for the house leading me by the hand and the children tagging after
test0521,when we got there she set me down in a split bottom chair and set herself down on a little little stool in front of me holding both of my hands and says
test0522,well it's lucky because sometimes people do get hurt
test0523,and i think he died afterwards he was a baptist
test0524,yes it was mortification that was it
test0525,your uncle's been up to the town every day to fetch you
test0526,you must have met him on the road didn't you old man with a
test0527,"well, child, it'll be stolen"
test0528,it was kind of thin ice but i says
test0529,i had my mind on the children all the time i wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little and find out who i was
test0530, pretty soon she made the cold chill strike all down my back because she says
test0531,i see it wasn't a bit of use to use to go ahead i'd got to throw up my hand
test0532,so i says to myself here's another place where i got to rest the truth
test0533,i opened my mouth to begin but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed and says here it comes
test0534,children don't you say a word
test0535,i see i was in a fix now
test0536,missus fels she jumps for him and says
test0537,has he come no says her husband
test0538,i can't imagine say the old man and i must say it makes me dreadful un easy
test0539,un easy she says i'm ready to go distracted
test0540,he must have come and you've missed him along the road
test0541,"oh, don't distress me any more and i'm already distressed"
test0542,why silis looky up the road isn't that somebody coming
test0543,the old gentleman stared and says
test0544,i ain't no idea who it is
test0545,it is tom sayer
test0546,being tom sayer was easy and comfortable and it stayed easy and comfortable until by and by i hear a boat boat coughing along down the river
test0547,then i says to myself suppose time sora comes down on that boat
test0548,but i am greatly pleased that you have seen my lady
test0549,i knew you could not choose but like her but yet let me tell you you have seen but the worst of her
test0550,her conversation has more charms and can be in mere beauty and a humor and disposition would make a deformable person appear lovely
test0551,why did you not send me that news and a gallon
test0552,well the best on it is that i have a squire now that is as good as a night
test0553,in honesty we have had such a scamper and upon so foolish an occasion as i cannot tell which is strange
test0554,all the people that i had ever in my life refused were brought again upon the stage like richard's third ghosts to reproach me with orh and all the kindness his discoveries could make i had for you was laid to my charge
test0555,my best qualities if i have any that are good served but for aggregations of my fault and i was allowed to have wit and understanding and discretion in other things that it might appear i had none in this
test0556,it is a strange change and i'm very sorry for it but i'll swear i know not how to help it
test0557,mister fish is a squire of dames and has so many misters that any one may pretend to share in him and be believed but though i have the honor to be his near neighbor to speak freely i cannot rag much that he makes any any to me and i know no young woman in the country that he does not visit often
test0558,i think my younger brother comes down with him
test0559,i can not sooner give you some little hints whereabout they live but you know them presently and i meant you should be beholding to me for your acquaintance
test0560,but it seems this gentleman is not so easy access but you may acknowledge something due to me if i incline him to look graciously upon you and therefore there is not much harm done
test0561,i have missed four fits and i have had but have had four five and have recovered so much strength as made me venture to meet your letter on wednesday a mile from home
test0562,but besides i can give you others
test0563,i am here much more out of people's way than in town where my aunt and such has pretend to interest in me and a power over me do so persecute me with their dear good nature and take it so ill that they are not accepted as i would live in a hollow tree to avoid them
test0564,you will think him altered and if it would be possible more melancholy than he was
test0565,if marriage agrees no better with other people than it does with him i shall pray that all my friends may escape it
test0566,well in honesty if i was a prince that lady should be my mistress but i can give no rule to anyone else and perhaps those that are in no danger of losing their hearts to her may be infinite taken with one i should not have value at all for so says a jestinian wise provence has ordained it that by their different humans it may be infinite taken with one i should not have value at all for so says a jestinian wise provence has ordained it that by their different humans it may be infinite taken with one i should not have value at all for so says a jestinian wise provence
test0567,the matter is not great for i confess i do naturally hate the noise and talk of the world and should be best pleased never to be known in it upon any occasion whatsoever yet since it can never be holily avoided one must satisfy itself by doing nothing that one need not care by doing nothing that one need not care
test0568,if i had a picture that would fit for you you should have it
test0569,how can you talk of defying fortune nobody lives without it and therefore why should you imagine you could
test0570,i know not how my brother comes to be so well informed as you say but i am sure he knows youmost of the injuries you have received from her
test0571,we have had another debate but much more calmly
test0572,and besides there was a time when we ourselves were indifferent to one other did i do so then or have i learned it since
test0573,i have been studying how tomcheek might come by his intelligence and i very believe he has it from my cousin peters
test0574,how kindly do i take the civilities of your fathers in earnest you cannot imagine how his letter pleased me
test0575,would it would leave me and then i could believe i shall not always have occasion for it
test0576,my poor lady vavasa is carried to the tower and her great belly could not excuse her because she was acquainted by someone that there was a plot against the protector and did not discover it
test0577,she has told now all that was told her but vows she will never say from where she had it we shall see whether the resolutions are as unalterable as those of my lady tamish
test0578,i wonder how she behaved herself when she was married
test0579,i never saw any one yet that did not look simply and out of countenances never knew a wedding well designed but one and that was of two people who were at time enough i confessed to contrive it and nobody to please in themselves
test0580,the truth is i could not endure to be missus bride in a public wedding to be made the happiest person on earth
test0581,do not take it ill for i would endure it if i could rather than fail but in earnest i do not think it were possible for me
test0582,yet in honesty your father will not find my brother paten wanting in civilty though he is not a man of much compliment unless it be in his letters to me nor an unreasonable person in anything so he will allow him out of his kindness to his wife to set higher value upon her sister and she deserves
test0583,my aunt told me no longer gone than yesterday that i was the most willful woman that ever knew and had an obstinance of spirit nothing could overcome take him
test0584,you see i give you fair warning
test0585,by the next i shall be gone to kent and my other journeys laid aside which i am not pleased at because it would have broken our course in very much
test0586,here are some verses of kaulies tell you how you like them
test0587,i told you in my last that my suffering journey was laid aside and that into kent hasten
test0588,if i drown by the way this will be my last letter and like a will i be i beweath all my kindnesses to you in it with a charge never to beost it all upon another mistress let my ghost rise again and haunt you to
test0589,indeed i like him extremely and he is commanded to me by people who know him very well and are able to judge for a most excellent servant and faithful as possible
test0590,because you find fault with my other letters this is like to be shorter than them i did not intended so however i can show you
test0591,i do not find it though i am told i was so extremely when i believed you love me
test0592,but i am called upon
test0593,directed for your master
test0594,i see you can chid when you please and with authority but i deserve it i confess and all i can say for myself is that my fault proceeded from a very good principle in me
test0595,we dare not let our tongues lie more on one side of our mouths than the other for fear of overturning it
test0596,you are satisfied i hope if this is that i escape drowning
test0597,but i am troubled much you should make so a journey to so little purpose indeed i read by the first post after my arrival here and cannot imagine how you came to miss of my letters
test0598,how welcome you will be but alas
test0599,for my life i can not beat into their heads a passion that must be subject to no decay an even perfect kindness that must last permanently without the least introduction
test0600,they laughed to hear me say that one unkind word would destroy all the satisfaction of my life and that i should expect our kindness should increase every day if it was possible but never less
test0601,we go abroad all day and play all night and say our prayers when we have time
test0602,well in sober earnings now i would not live as a twelve months to gain all that the king has lost unless it was to give it him again
test0603,will you be so good natured?
test0604,he has one son and it is the finest boy that ever you saw and has a noble spirit but but stands in the awe of his father that one word from him is as much as twenty whipping
test0605,you must give me leave to entertaining you with discussions of the family for i can tell you nothing else from hence
test0606,not to know when you would come home i can assure you nor for any other time of my own but with a cousin of mine that had long long to make herself sport with him and did not miss of miss my aim
test0607,in my life i never heard so ridiculous in discourse as he made us and no old woman who passes for a witch could have been more puzzled to seek what to say to reasonable people than he was
test0608,ever since this adventure i have had so great a belief in all things with this nature that i could not forbear laying a pees card with nine nine inches under my door yesterday and was informed by it that my husband's name should be thomas how do you like that
test0609,she pulled her hair down turned her skirt back put her feet on the fender and took putter into her lap all of which arrangements indicated that something very important had got to be thought over and settled
test0610,the more proposals the more credit
test0611,i've tried it and liked it and maybe this is the consequence of that night's fun
test0612,just suppose it is true that he does ask me and i say yes
test0613,what a spitting thing i am
test0614,i could do so much for all at home how i should enjoy that
test0615,let me see how can i begin
test0616,he has known her all her life and has a good influence over her
test0617,now as polly was by no means a perfect creature i am free to confess that the old temptation assaulted her more than once that week for when the first excitement of the dashing reform had subsided she missed the beautiful little interviews that used to put a certain flavor of romance into her dull working days
test0618,i don't think it was his wealth accomplishments or position that most attracted polly though these doubtless possessed a greater influence than she suspected
test0619,it was that indescribable something which women are quick to see and feel in men who have been blessed with wise and good mothers
test0620,this had an a special charm to polly for she soon found that this side of her character was not shown to everyone
test0621,lately this had changed especially towards polly and it flitted her more than she would confess even to herself
test0622,at first she tried to think she could but unfortunately hearts are so contrary that they won't be obedient to reason will or even credititude
test0623,polly felt a very charming friendship for mister sydney but not one particle of the love which is the only coin in which love is truly paid
test0624,this finished polly's decision and after that night she never allowed herself to develop upon the pleasant temptation which came in a gaze particularly attractive to a young girl with the spies of the old eve in the composition
test0625,when saturday came polly started as usual for visit to becky and bees but could not resist stopping at the shores to leave a little parcel for fan though it was calling time
test0626,a foolish little speech to make to a dark but you see polly was only a tenderhearted girl trying to do her duty
test0627,take hold of massachusetts charlise's miss mae and look beautiful like willy and flusty said the maid
test0628,at a street corner a black-eyed school boy was parting from a rosy face school girl whose music role he was reluctantly surrendering
test0629,how he got there was never very clear to polly but there he was flushed and a little out of breath but looking so glad to see her until she had not the heart to be stiff and cool as she had fully intended to be when they met
test0630,she really could not help it it was so pleasant to see him again just when she was feeling so lonely
test0631,"that is the way i get to the rus, said poly"
test0632,she did not mean to tell but his fairness was so agreeable she forgot herself
test0633,but i know her better and i assure you that she does improve she tries to mean her thoughts though she won't own it and will surprise you some day by the amount of heart and sense in goodness she has got
test0634,"thank you, no."
test0635,how lovely the park looks she said in great confusion
test0636,as the art for young man laying a trap into which polly immediately fell
test0637,he was quicker to take a hint than he had expected and being both proud and generous weis off to settle the matter at once for poly's sake as well as his own
test0638,so when she made her last brilliant remark she said quietly watching her face quietly all the while i was going out of town on business for several weeks so you can enjoy your little bit of country without being annoyed by me
test0639,she thought she had a good deal of the coquette in her and i have no doubt that with time and draining she would have been a very dangerous little person but now she was far too transparent and straightforward by nature even to tell a white like levely
test0640,he was gone before she could do anything and look up at him with a remorseful face and she walked on feeling that the first and perhaps the only woman she would ever have had had his answer and accepted it in silence
test0641,polly did not return to her favorite walk until she learned from mini that uncle had really left town and then she found that his friendly company and conversation was what had made the way so pleasant after all
test0642,working two and four as usual what's the news with you?
test0643, perhaps shielded him
test0644,the utterly done with and laid upon the shelf
test0645,mini said the other day she wished she was a pigeon so she could paddle in the pats and not fuss with rappers
test0646,now don't be affected polly but just tell me like a deer has not he proposed
test0647,don't you think he means to
test0648,"truly, juley fan."
test0649,i don't mean to being praying but i really thought he did.
test0650,well i always meant to try it if i got a chance and i have
test0651,i just gave him a hint and he took it
test0652,he meant to go away before that so then don't think his heart is broken or mind what teddy teller's say
test0653,he understood and being a gentleman made no fuss
test0654,but polly it would have been a great thing for you
test0655,"i'm odd, you know. and i prefer to be an independent spinster and teach music all my days."
test0656,"never mind what the business was it seems to say that it was a good beginning for a young man like tom who have been born and born in the most conservative class of the most conceived city in new england needed just the healthy, hearty, social influences of the west to widen his views and make a man of him"
test0657,fortunately every one was so busy with the necessary preparations that there was no time for romans of any sort and the four young people worked together as silently as as all sorts of emotions were not bottled up in their respective hearts
test0658,pity that the end will come so soon but the hour did its work and went its way leaving a clearer atmosphere behind but the young folks did not see it then for their eyes were dim because of the parting step that must be
test0659,if it had not been for two things i fear she never would have stood a summer in town but sydney often called to his vacation came and the voluminous correlations with polly begeled the long days
test0660,tum wrote once a week to his mother the letters were short and not very satisfying for men never do tell the interesting little things that women best like to hear
test0661,now i'm only tired had a good thing to do now and the weather makes me just a travel bro.
test0662,"forgive me, polly, i can't help saying it for is there and i want to be as true to you as you were to me if i can."
test0663,i try to deceive myself but it seems as if there was a chance of happiness for me.
test0664,"thank heaven for that,"
test0665,godly polly with the hardiest satisfaction in her voice.
test0666,poor polly was so taken by surprise that she had not a word to say.
test0667,no when needed she told her face entered for her as well as the impulse which made her hide her head in the sofa cushion like a foolish ostrich when the hands are after it
test0668,once or twice but sort of chucklingly and i thought it was only some little flapping.
test0669,it was so stupid of me not to guess before.
test0670,it was so tender honest and defiant that fanny forgot the defense of her own love in admiration of polly's loyalty to her for this faithful all absorbing love was a new revelation to fanny who was used to hearing her friend's boast of two or three lovers a year and calculate their respective values with almost as much coolness as the young man discussed the fortunes of the girls he wished for but could not afford to marry
test0671,i hope maria baley's only thing she said softly for i could not bear to have him disappointed again.
test0672,"said fanny, turning hopeful all at once."
test0673,"suppose i say a word to tum just inquire after his heart and a channel away, you know and give me a chance to tell me if there's anything to tell."
test0674,bare it people always do bear things somehow and said polly looking as if sentence had been passed upon her.
test0675,it was a very different window from the last for both the girls.
test0676,if anyone wanted to show him what she could do towards making a pleasant home she certainly succeeded by but she suspected for in spite of many failures and discourages behind the scenes the little house became a more attractive place to mister sydney at least for he was more a house friend than ever and seemed determined to prove the change of fortune made no difference to him
test0677,she kept much at home when the day's work was done finding it pleasant to sit dreaming of a book or so alone than to exert herself even to go to the shores.
test0678,polly was not at all like herself that window and those near to her saw and wandered at it most.
test0679,for net was so absorbed in business that he ignored the whole baley question and left them in other darkness.
test0680,then he came walking upon her one day looking as if she poor held of such great joy that she hardly knew how to tell them.
test0681,but if work baskets were gifted with powers of speech they could tell stories more true and tender than any we read.
test0682,she had even been in society before the revolution
test0683,it was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names on every pretext
test0684,every year she solmously renewed her vows and at the moment of taking the oath she said to the priest monsieur saint franceso gave it to monsieur monsieur saint julians gave it to monsieur monsieur saint julians gave it to monsieur monsieur saint julians gave it to monsieur monsieur saint julians gave it to monsier monsier saint franceso gave it to monsier monsier saint julians gave it to monsier monsier saint julians gave it to monsier monsier saint julians gave it to monsier monsier saint julians gave it to monsier monsier saint julians gave it to monsier monsier saint julians gave it to monsier monsier monsier monsier
test0685,and the school girls would begin to laugh not in their sleeves but under their bales charming little little laughed which made the vocal mothers frown
test0686,it was a century which spoke through her but it was the eighteen century
test0687,the rule of fontravele did not forbid this
test0688,she would not show the object to anyone
test0689,so thus it furnished a subject of comment for all those who were on occupied or board in the convent
test0690,some unique chappel some authentic relic
test0691,they lost themselves in conjectures
test0692,when the poor old woman died they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting perhaps and opened it
test0693,he is resisting fluttering his tiny wings and still making an effort to fly but the dancers are laughing with a satanic air
test0694,moral love conquered by the colloks
test0695,the prioris returned and seated herself once more on her chair
test0696,we will present a stenographic report of the dialogue which then ensued to the best of our ability
test0697,father forvent
test0698,reverent mother do you know the chapel
test0699,and you have been in the choir and pursuit of your duties two or three times
test0700,there is a stone to be raised heavy
test0701,the slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar
test0702,the slab which closes the vault yes
test0703,it would be a good thing to have two men for it
test0704,a woman is never a man
test0705,because domma mybalan gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of saint santero while muriel's horses only gives three hundred and sixty seven i do not despise muriel's horses neither do i
test0706,marriage consists in working according to one's strength a coater is not a dockyard
test0707,and a woman is not a man but my brother is the strong one though
test0708,and can you get a gift?
test0709,there is a ring in the stone
test0710,i will put through it
test0711,that is good reverend mother i will open the vault
test0712,will that be all no
test0713,"give you my orders, very reverent mother"
test0714,for that we have confidence in you
test0715,i am here to do anything you wish
test0716,and to hold your piece about everything yes reverend mother
test0717,when the vault is open i will close it again
test0718,but before that what reveren mother
test0719,father of venn reverent mother
test0720,you know that a mother died this morning
test0721,no did you not hear the bell?
test0722,nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden really
test0723,and then the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning
test0724,it was mother crucifixion
test0725,three years ago now madam de busson a jansson's turned orthodox merely from having seen mother's death in prayer ah
test0726,the mothers have taken her to the dead bed which opens on the church i know
test0727,a fine site it would be to see a man to the bedroom more often
test0728,hay more often
test0729,what do you say?
test0730,i say more often more often than what
test0731,reverent mother i did not say more often than what i said more often
test0732,but i did not say more often
test0733,at that moment nine o'clock struck
test0734,at nine o'clock in the morning and at all hours prayed and adored to be the most holy sacrament of the altar said the prises
test0735,it cut more often short
test0736,folvin mopped his head
test0737,in her life time mother crucifixion made conversions after her death she will perform miracles she will
test0738,ffather vent the community has been blessed in mother crucifixion
test0739,she retained her consciousness to the very last moment
test0740,she gave her the last commands
test0741,if you had a little more faith and if you could have been in her cell she would have cured her leg merely by touching it she smiled
test0742,there was something of paradise in that death
test0743,flourloft thought that it was an orison which she was finishing
test0744,forlward held his piece she went on
test0745,i have consulted upon this point many eclesiastics laboring in our lord who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life and bear wonderful fruit
test0746,fortunately the prizis completely absorbed in her own thoughts did not hear it
test0747,she continued further prevent
test0748,"yes, reveren mother"
test0749,staintrencis bishop of port where the mouth of the tibie empty's into the sea requested that on his tomb would be engraved the sign which was placed on the graves of parasites in the hope that passersby would spit on his tomb this was done
test0750,the dead must be obeyed so be it
test0751,"for that matter, no matter that matter not, reverend"
test0752,forfather mother crucifixion will be inserted in the coffin in which she has slept for the last twenty years that is just
test0753,it is a continuation of her slumber
test0754,so i shall have to nail up that coffin yes
test0755,i am at the orders of the very reverent community
test0756,the four mother presenters will assist you
test0757,no in lowering the coffin
test0758,where in the vault
test0759,foule's vault started the vault under the altar
test0760,under the altar but
test0761,you will have an iron bar yes but
test0762,you will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring but
test0763,the dead must be obeyed to be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel not to go to profane earth to remain there in death where she prayed while living such was the last wish of mother death
test0764,she asked it of us that is to say commanded us
test0765,but it is forbidden
test0766,"oh, i am a stone in your walls"
test0767,think father of ven if she was to work miracles here
test0768,what a glory of god for the community and miracles issue from tombs
test0769,but reverent mother is the agent of the sanitary commission
test0770,but the commission of police
test0771,shonon demar one of the seven german kings who entered among the gals under the empire of consantia expressively recognized the right of none to be buried in religion that is to be say beneath the altar
test0772,the world is nothing in the presence of the cross
test0773,martin the eleventh general of the carthusians gave to his order this device st crew doom volvuror arbor
test0774,the prises who is usually subject to the barrier of silence and its reservoir was over full rose and exclaimed with the lucidity of a dam which has broken away
test0775,i have on my right bennon and on my left bernard who was bernard
test0776,the first abab of clarva
test0777,his order has produced forty pope's two hundred cardinals sixty five patricians sixteen hundred archbishops four thousand six hundred bishops four thousand six hundred bishops for emperors twelve empresses forty six kings forty two queens three thousand six hundred canonized saints and has been in existence for sixteen hundred years
test0778,on one side saint bernard on the other the agent of the sanitary department
test0779,god subverted to the commission of police such as the age silence forvo
test0780,no one doubts the right of the monastery to sepiurte
test0781,only fanatics and those in error deny it
test0782,we live in times of terrible confusion
test0783,we are ignorant and imps.
test0784,and then religion is attacked why
test0785,because there have been bad priests because sagatari bishop of gap was the brother of sagatari bishop of ember and because both of them followed maam all
test0786,they persecuted the saints
test0787,they shut their eyes to the truth darkness is the rule
test0788,the most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind
test0789,oh how wicked people are
test0790,by order of the king signifies to day by order of the revolution
test0791,one no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead a holy death is prohibited
test0792,guthier bishop of shalon held his own in this matter against otho duke of burgundy
test0793,the priser took breath then turned to foshal
test0794,you will close the coffin the sisters will carry it to the chapel
test0795,the office for the dead will then be set
test0796,but she will hear she will not listen
test0797,besides what the close knows the world learns not
test0798,a pause in suit
test0799,you will remove your bell.
test0800,has the doctor for the dead paid his visit
test0801,he will pay at four o'clock day
test0802,the peel which orders the doctor for the death to be summoned has already been wrong
test0803,but you do not understand any of the peals
test0804,that is well father prevent
test0805,where will you obtain it?
test0806,i have my heap of old stone at the bottom of the garden
test0807,reverent mother what
test0808,if you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort my brother is the strong man for you a perfect turk
test0809,you will do it as quickly as possible
test0810,i cannot be very fast i'm firm that is why i require an assistant i limp
test0811,everything must have been completed a good quarter of an hour before that
test0812,i will do anything to prove my fear towards the community these are my orders i am to nail the coffin
test0813,at eleven o'clock exactly i am to be in the chapel
test0814,mother's birth will be there two men would be better
test0815,however never mind i will have my lover
test0816,after which there will be no trace of anything
test0817,the government will have no suspicion
test0818,the empty coffin remains this produced a pause
test0819,what is to be done with that coffin father
test0820,it will be given to the earth empty
test0821,"aah, leader exhaled, exhaled."
test0822,the vail stuck fast in his throat
test0823,he made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath
test0824,i will put the earth in the coffin reverend mother that will produce the effect of a corpse
test0825,i will make that my special business
test0826,"general observations on preserves, confectionary ices and dessert dishes"
test0827,the expense of preserving them with sugar is a serious objection for except a sugar is used in considerable qualities the success is very uncertain
test0828,fruit grown in wet and foggy weather will soon be melded and be of no service for preserves
test0829,but to distinguish these properly requires very attention and considerable experience
test0830,if you dip the finger into the serv and apply to the thumb the toughness of the serv will on separating the finger and thumb afford a thread which soon breaks this is the little thread
test0831,let it boil up again and then take it off and remove carefully the scum that has risen
test0832,it is considered to be sufficiently boiled when some taken up in a spoon pours out like oil
test0833,before sugar was in use honey was employed to preserve many vegetable productions though this substance is now given to the juice of the sugar cane
test0834,fourteen hundred nine
test0835,boil them up three days successfully scimming each time and they will then be finished and in a state fit to be put into pots for use
test0836,the reason why the fruit is emptying out of the preserving pan into an earthy pan is that the acid of the fruit acts upon the copper of which the preserving pans are usually made
test0837,from this example the process of preserving fruits from syrup would be easily understood
test0838,they should be dried in the stove or oven on a seve and turned every six or eight hours fresh powdered sugar was sifting over them every time they are turned
test0839,in this way it is also that orange and lemon chips are preserved
test0840,"marmalades, jams and fruit sauce is of the same nature and are now in very general quest"
test0841,marmaline and jams differ little from each other their preserves of half liquid consistency made by boiling the pulp of fruits and sometimes part of the rines with sugar
test0842,that they may keep it is necessary not to be sparing of sugar fifteen o three
test0843,in all the operations for preservation making when the preservation pan is used it should not be placed on the fire but on a tribit unless the jam is made on a hot plate when this is not necessary
test0844,confectionary fifteen o eight
test0845,"in speaking of confectionary should be remarked that all the various preparations above named come strictly speaking under that head from the various fruits, flowers, herbs and fruits and fruits and juices which when boiled with sugar were formally employed in pharmacy as well as for sweet meats were called confectioners from the latin word conferis to make up but the term confectionary embraces a very large class indeed of sweet food many kinds of which should not be attempted in the ordinary cuisine"
test0846,the thousand and one ornamented dishes that adorned the tables of the wealthy should be purchased from the confectioner they can not profitably be made at home
test0847,however as late as the rain of our two last georgia's fantastic sums were often expended upon fanciful desserts
test0848,the shape of the dishes varies at different periods the prevailing fashion at present being oval and circular dishes on stems
test0849,izis
test0850,at desserts or at some evening parties ices are scarcely to be dispensed with
test0851,the spatel is generally made of copper kept bright and clean
test0852,they should be taken immediately after the repast or some hours after because the taking of these substances during the process of digestion is apt to provoke in disposition
test0853,there was once on a time a widow who had a son and a daughter by his first wife
test0854,from the very day that the new wife came into the house there was no peace for the men's children and not a corner to be found where they could get any rest so the boy thought that the best thing he could do was to go out into the world and try to earn his own bread
test0855,but his sister who was still at home fared worse and worse
test0856,kiss me girl said the head
test0857,when the king entered in and saw he stood still as if he were in feters and could not stir from the spot for the picture seemed to him so beautiful
test0858,the young promise to make all the hasty he could and set forth from the king's palace
test0859,at last they came inside of land
test0860,well if my brother says so i must do it said the man's daughter and she flung her casket into the sea
test0861,what is my brother saying asked his sister again
test0862,on the first sunday night after this a beautiful maiden came into the kitchen of the palace and begged the kitchen maid who slept there to give her brush
test0863,she begged very prittily and got it and then she brushed her hair and the gold dropped from it
test0864,out on the ugly bushy bride sleeping so soft by the young king's side on sand and stones my bed i make and my brother sleeps with a cold snake un-pitied and unwept
test0865,i will come twice more and then never again said she
test0866,this time also as before she borrowed a brush and brushed her hair with it and the gold dropped down as she did it and again she sent the dog out three times and when day dawned she departed but as she was going she said as she had said before i shall come once more and then and never again
test0867,no one can tell how delighted the king was to get rid of that hideous bushy bride and get a queen who was bright and beautiful as day itself
test0868,wilt not serve me and watch my seven folds as the king
test0869,the youth thought that it was very easy work to watch the folds and that he could do it well enough.
test0870,has watch you faithfully and well the whole day long said the king when the lamb came into his presence in the evening
test0871,yes that i have said the use
test0872,he had gone out once to seek a place he said but never would he do such a thing again
test0873,then the king promised him the same punishment and the same reward that he had promised his brother
test0874,"when he had run after the fols for a long, long time and was hot and tired he passed by a celt in the rock where an old woman was sitting spinning with the distis and she called to him"
test0875,come here come here my handsome son and let me comb your hair
test0876,the youth like the thought of this let the holes run where they chose and seated himself in the clute of the rock by the side of the old hag
test0877,so there he sat with her head on her lap taking her ease the live long day
test0878,on the third day sidad wanted to set out
test0879,the two brothers laughed at him and his father and mother asked him not to go but to all to no purpose and cinderlads went out on his way
test0880,i'm walking about in search of a place at cinderad
test0881,i would much rather have the princess at cinderlad
test0882,"and thus they journeyed forward a long, long way."
test0883,when they had gone for a long long way the full again asked do you see anything now
test0884,yes now i see something that is white said cinderella
test0885,it looks like a chunk of a great thick bark tree
test0886,cinderlad had but could not do it so he had to take a draw from the pitcher and then one more and after that still another and then he was able to wheel the sword with perfect ease
test0887,for we are brothers of the princess whom you are to have when now you tell the king who you are to have when now you tell the king who you are to drink but there's a mighty thief who has cast a spell over us
test0888,when they had traveled a long long way the full said does not see anything
test0889,and now inquired of me do you still nothing now
test0890,now then said the full do i not see anything now
test0891,that is a river said the full and we have to cross it
test0892,"i've done my reply, sir, lad."
test0893,once upon a time there was a king in the north who had won many wars but now he was old
test0894,the old king went out and fought bravely but at last his sword broke and he was wounded and his men fled
test0895,but in the night when the battle was over his young wife came out and search for him among the slain and at last she found him and asked whether he might be healed

test1037,the grave diggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at night in winter in this cemetery they were subject to a special discipline

test1095,education family feeling the sense of duty the family are strong sentinels but there are no sentinels so vigilant as not to be deceived by a girl of sixteen to whom nature is but the voice of the man he loves gives the first council of love all the more ardent because they seem so pure
test1096,the more girl believes in goodness the more isly will she give way if not to her lover at least to love for being without mistrust she is without force and to win her love is a triumph that can be gained by any young men of five and twenty see how young girls are watched and guarded
test1097,then how surely must they desire the world which is hidden from them how surely must they find it tempting how surely must they listen to the first voice which comes to tell its secrets through their bars and bless the hand which it is the first to raise a corner of the mystery wale
test1098,with them the body has worn out the soul the senses have burned up the heart dissipation has blunted the feelings
test1099,they love by profession and not by instinct.
test1100,when a creature who has all her past to reproach herself with is taken at all at once by a profound and sincere irresistible love of which she had never felt herself capable when she has confessed her love how absolutely the man who she loves dominates her
test1101,they know not what proof to give.
test1102,in order to disturb the laborers in the field was one day destroyed by a wolf because those whom he had so often deceived no longer believed in his cries for help
test1103,this is the same with these unhappy women when they love seriously.
test1104,but when the man who inspires this redeeming love is great enough in soul to receive it without remembering the past when he gives himself up to it when in short he loves as he is loved this man drains at one drought all earthy emotions and after such a love his heart will be closed to every other
test1105,but to return to the first day of my leaion on
test1106,"when i reached home, i was in the state of mad gaiety."
test1107,the woman becomes the man's mistress and loves him.
test1108,how why?
test1109,my whole being was exhaled into joy at the memory of the words we had exchanged during that first night.
test1110,here are my orders tonight at adobeville
test1111,calm during the third and tracked.
test1112,the boxes were filled one after another.
test1113,only one remains empty the stage box.
test1114,at the beginning of the third act i heard the door of the box on which my eyes had been almost constantly fixed open and margarette appeared.
test1115,do she love me enough to believe that the more beautiful she looked the happier i should be
test1116,what is the match with you tonight said margaret rising and coming to the back of the box and kissing me on the head
test1117,"you should go to bed, she replied with that ironic era which went so well with her delicate and witty face."
test1118,where at home
test1119,you still love me can you ask
test1120,because you don't like seeing him
test1121,however i was very unhappy all the rest of the evening and went away very sadly after having seen prudence the count and margaret get into the carriage which was waiting for them at the door
test1122,i have not come to hinder you from leaving paris.
test1123,"you are in the way margaret, but how?"
test1124,"well, you might have had a woman here, said prudens and it would hardly have been amusing for her to see two more arrive."
test1125,"during this remark, margarete looked at me attentively."
test1126,"my dear prudence, i answered he does not know what you are saying."
test1127,"yes, but besides not wishing to put you out i was sure that if you came as far as my door you would want to come up and as i could not let you go away blaming me for saying no"
test1128,because i am watched and the least suspicion might do me the greatest harm.
test1129,is that really the only reason?
test1130,if there were any other i would tell you for we are not to have any secrets from one another now.
test1131,"honestly, do you care for me a little a great deal"
test1132,i fancied for a moment that i might give myself that happiness for six months you would not have it you insisted on knowing the means
test1133,well good heavens the means were easy enough to guess
test1134,i listened and i gazed the margaret with admiration.
test1135,when i thought that this marvelous creature whose feet i had once longed to kiss was willing to let me take my place in her thoughts my part in her life and that i was not yet content with what she gave me i asked if man's desire had indeed limits when satisfied as promptly my mind had been it reached after something further
test1136,"true, she continued we poor creatures of chance have fantastic desire and impossible loves."
test1137,we are not allowed to have hearts on the penalty of being hooted down and of ruining our credit.
test1138,"we no longer belong to ourselves,"
test1139,we stand first in their self-esteem last in their self-esteem.
test1140,never do they give you advice which is not lucrative.
test1141,it means little enough to them that we should have ten lovers extra as long as they have dresses or a bracelet out of them and that they can drive in our carriage from time to time or to come to our box at the theater
test1142, such a man i found in the duke but the duke is old and the old age neither protects nor consoles
test1143,i thought i could accept the life which he offered me but what would you have?
test1144,what i loved in you was not the man who was but the man who was going to be
test1145,margarete tired out with his long confession threw herself back on the sofa and to stifle a slight cough put up a little cough up her mouth to her lips and from that to her eyes
test1146,margaret do with me as you will i am your slave your dog but in the name of heaven tear up the letter which i wrote to you and do not make me leave you tomorrow it would kill me
test1147,margaret drew the letter from her bosom and sending it to me with a smile of infinite sweetness said
test1148,here it is i have brought it back.
test1149,i threw the letter into fragments and kissed with tears the hand that gave it to me.
test1150,"look here pudens, do you know what he wants said margaret"
test1151,he wants you to forgive him.
test1152,"one has to, but he wants more than that what then?"
test1153,i embraced margarete until she was almost stiffed.
test1154,almost mister buzzed grind
test1155,this sounded like another story.
test1156,he was curious about that black headed cousin of all mister mister mister mister buda very curious indeed.
test1157,"anyway, he would find out,"
test1158,"please mister buzzers, please tell us the story he bagged."
test1159,now all mister buzzel is naturally good natured and accommodating and when peter bagged so hard he just couldn't find it in his heart to refuse.
test1160,way back in the days when grandpa buster had his little falling out with old king eagle and then fly so high he scared the feathers off in his head he had a cousin did grandpa buster and this cousin was just naturally lazy and no count
test1161,like most no count people he used to make a regular nuisance of himself poking his nose into everybody's business and never tending to his own.
test1162, wasn't anything going on that this trilling member of the buzzers family didn't find out about a metal in he could ask more questions than peter rabbit can and anyone that can do that has had to ask a lot
test1163,everybody looked at peter and laughed.
test1164,so wean's sitting on the chimney tops whenever all old jack frost gets to strain down where he have no business.
test1165,one day this no count trilling cousin of grandpa bussard get cold in his feet.
test1166,it was on a little old house a little old tumbling down house.
test1167,why he just stretched his full head as far down the chimney as he can and listen and listen.
test1168,but he doesn't mind that
test1169,will you all please speak a little louder? he hollers down the chimney just like that.
test1170,"the yes, she surely was plumb scared."
test1171,they like to choke to death.
test1172,when he get home he try and try to brush the suit off but it doesn't get into the skin and it stays there.
test1173,a little sigh of satisfaction went round the circle of listeners.
test1174,it was just as good as one of grandfather's frogs
test1175,draw reach fill mix give me without water
test1176,so my friend so whip me off this glass neatly bring me hethers some claret a full weaning until it run over

test1234,in the meantime fry john with his formidable baton of the cross got to the breach which the enemies had made and there stood to snatch up those that endeavored to escape
test1235,it is significant to note in this connection that the new king was an unswirling adherent of the cult of asher by the adhesion of which he was probably strongly supported
test1236,at the beginning of his rain there was much social discontent and suffering
test1237,well might sharid exclaim in the words of the prophet where is the king of arpad
test1238,tilgathelles however cross the ufaids and moving northward delivered an unexpected attack on a regional army in kumkum
test1239,a fierce battle ensued and one of his dramatic incidents was a single combat between the rival kings
test1240,an attempt was made to capture king chardus who leaped from his chariot and made hasty escape on horseback hotly pursued in the gathering darkness by an asian contigent of calvin
test1241,despite the blow delled against you to asiria did not immediately regain possession of north syria
test1242,the shifting mattey iil either cherished the hope that shadron would recover strength and again invade north syria or that he might himself establish an empire in that region
test1243,till lags by leisure had therefore to march west again
test1244,for three years he conducted the vigorous campaigns in the western land where he meant with vigorous resistance
test1245,our pad was captured and matteil iil deposed and probably put to death
test1246,once again the hebrews came into contact with this area
test1247,its fall may not have been unconnected with the trend of events in israel during the closing years of the middle empire
test1248,jeha ash the grandson of jeha had achieved success in conflict with damasas
test1249,six months afterwards he was assassinated by shalum
test1250,this underer held way at samaria for only a month
test1251,no resistance was possible on the part of manahem the usurper who was probably ready to welcome the asian conqueror so that by arranging an alliance he might secure his own position
test1252,tlathla policeer next operated against the medium and other hill tribes in the north east

test1266,as i thought that this was due to some fault in the earth i wanted to make these first experiments before i undertook my perseus
test1267,when i saw this bust came out sharp and clean i said it once to construct a little furnace in the workshop erected for me by the duke after my own plans and design in the house which the duke had given me
test1268,it was an extremely difficult task and i was anxious to observe all the nice's of art which i had learned so was so to lapse into some error
test1269,i in my turn feel the same desire and hope to play my part like them therefore my lord give me the leave to go
test1270,but be aware of letting bandellene quit you rather boast upon him always more than he demands for if he goes into foreign parts his ignorance is so presumuous that he is just the man to disgrace our most elistical school
test1271,i asked no further reward for my labor's work to this time than the gracious favor of your most illustrious excellence
test1272,then i thanked him and said i had no greater desire than to show those envious people who i had in me to execute the promised work
test1273,i had better look to my conduct for it had come to his ears that i had relied on his favor to take in first one man and then another
test1274,i begged his most illustrious excellence to name a single person who i had ever taken in
test1275,i said my lord i thank you and ask you to condense so far as to listen to four words it is true that he let me a pair of old scales two enveas and three little hammers which articles i begged his workman georgio of cortona fifteen days ago to fetch back
test1276,georgio came for his health
test1277,i hope to prove on what account that scandal tries to bring me into this grace
test1278,when he had heard this speech the duke rose up in anger and sent for the berandaon who was forced to take flight as far as venice he and antonio landy with him
test1279,you would put this to the proof and i will go at once to the bargellie
test1280,i am willing to enter into competition with the ancientes and feel able to surpass them for those early days in which i made the metals of pope clameon i have learned so much that i can also outdo the coins i struck for duck of galsandra which are still held in high esteem in like manner i could make for you many pieces of gold and silver plate as i did so often for that noble monarch king of france thanks to the great convenience of the kind i can also outdo the coins i struck for duck of galsandra which are still held in high esteem in like manner i can make for you many pieces of gold and silver plate as i did so often for that noble monarch king of france
test1281,after several months were wasted and pierre would neither work nor put men to work on the piece i made him give it back
test1282,among artists certain rage sculptors laughed at me and called me the new sculptor
test1283,now i hope to show them that i am a old sculptor if god will grant me the bown of finishing my perseus for that noble pizza of his most impressive excellence
test1284,having this excellent resolve in heart i reached my home
test1285,walders was rather sely after the ladies had flown away from the scene and he drank his liquor doggedly
test1286,it was his fantasy i suppose to revive certain sentimental relations which had it may be once had between him and miss lake and he was a person of that combative temperament that magnifies an object in proportion as its pursuit is thourted
test1287,the story of fridolin and wicked's pretty outlines
test1288,sit down beside me and i'll tell you the story.
test1289,he assisted at it but took no part and in fact was listening to that other conversation which sounded with its pleasant gabbles and laughter like a little musical tink of bells in the distance
test1290,but honest mark forgot young ladies do not always come out quite alone and jump unassisted into their vehicles
test1291,but the middle sun was little in lora he was neither dark nor fair he was neither dark nor fair he was neither handsome or strong
test1292,throwing himself on his knees before the king he cried oh royal sire baste upon me also a sword and in an deed that i may up and in the way to follow my brother
test1293,but the king laughed him to scorn thou a sword he said
test1294,inthou shalt have one but it shall be one but it shall be one befitting thy maiden size and courage so a small weapon can be found in all my kingdom
test1295,fourth forth with the grinning gesture began shreeking with laughter so that the bells by his moly cap were all set of jangling
test1296,i did but laugh to think that the sword of eltheride had been so quickly found responded the gesture and he pointed to the scissors hanging from the taylor's gurt
test1297,one night as he lay in a deep forest too unhappy to sleep he heard a noise near at hand in the bushes
test1298,you shall shall have your liberty he cried even though you shall shoud run me and peace in the moment you aren't free
test1299,it had suddenly disappeared and in its place stood a beautiful fairy with filmy wings with shone like roses in the moonlight
test1300,at this moment there was a distant rumbling as of thunder tis the oger cried the fairy we must hasten
test1301,cissors grow a giant's height and save us from the ogers' might.
test1302,he could see the oger standing powerless to hurt him on the other side of the cask and nashing his teeth each one of which was as big as a millstone
test1303,the sight was so terrible that he turned on his head and fled away as fast as his feet could carry him
test1304,you shall not be left a prisoner in this stimeless spot while i have the power to help you
test1305,he lifted the scissors and with one stroke destroyed the web and gave the fly's freedom
test1306,a faint glimmer of light on the opposite wall shows me the key hole
test1307,the prince spent all the following time until midnight trying to think of a suitable verse to say to the scissors
test1308,as he uttered the words the swords leaped down of his hand and began to cut through the wooden shuds as easily as through through the wooden shuds as easily as through through the cheese
test1309,in a very short time the prince and crawled through the opening
test1310,while he stood looking around him and bewilderment a firefly lighted on his hand flashing its little lantern in the prince's face it cried this way my friend the fly sent me to guide you to a place of safety
test1311,what has to become of me cried the poor peasant
test1312,my grain must fall and rot in the field from over ripeness because i have not the strength to rise and harvest it then indeed must we all starve
test1313,the grand dame whom he supplied with faggots the merchant whom he rescued from robbers the king's counselor to whom he gave aid all became his friends up and down the land to begger or lord homeless wanderer or high born dame he gladly gave self for service all un-sought and such as he helped straight away became his friends
test1314,to him who could bring her back to her father's castle should be given the throne and kingdom as well as the princess herself so from far and near indeed from almost every country under the sun came kings and princes to fight the oger
test1315,among those who drew back were elthered's brothers the three that were dark and the three that were fair
test1316,ethel read he did not their tauts
test1317,so they all cried out long and loud long live the prince prince is all
test1318,he felt what the earth may possibly feel at the moment when it is torn open with the iron in order to grain may be deposited within it it feels only the wound the quiver of the germ the joy of the fruit only arrived later
test1319,he had but just acquired a faith must he then reject it already
test1320,he affirmed to himself that he would not he declared to himself that he would not doubt and he began to doubt in spite of himself
test1321,to stand between two religions from one of which you have not as yet emerged and another into which you have not yet entered is intolerable and twilight is pleasing only to bat like souls
test1322,marius was clear-eyed and he required the true light
test1323,the half lights of doubt painted him
test1324,whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was he could not halt there he was impossiblely constrained to continue to advance to examine to think to march further
test1325,he feared after having taken so many steps which had brought him closer to his father to now take a step which would restrain him from that father
test1326,his discomfort was amplified by all the reflections which occurred to him
test1327,in the troubled state of his conscience he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence
test1328,they soon elbows him abruptly
test1329,"request corf for to come and talk with me, said maria."
test1330,"what is to become of you, said currarac."
test1331,what are you going to do i do not know
test1332,silver gold here it is.
test1333,you will then have only a pair of trousers a west suit a hat and a coat and my boots
test1334,that will be enough
test1335,"no, it is not good. what will you do after that?"
test1336,do you know german no?
test1337,"it is badly paid work, but one can live by it."
test1338,the clothes dealer was sent for.
test1339,he paid twenty francs for the cast off garments they went to the watchmakers
test1340,he bought the watch for forty five francs
test1341,"hello, i'd forgotten that, smaris"
test1342,the landowner presented his bill which had to be paid on the spot
test1343,"i have ten francs left, said marie."
test1344,that will be swallowing a tongue very fast or a hundred sue very slowly
test1345,one morning on his return to the law school marie has found a letter from his aunt and the sixty pistol that is to say six hundred francs and gold in a sealed box
test1346,marie sent back the thirty louy to his aunt with a respectful letter in which he stated that he had sufficient means of subsistence and that he should be able to lens forth to supply all his needs
test1347,at that moment he had three franks left
test1348,he perceived that it was no good talking to the old men and that the principal person in the house was the mother
test1349,before her he decided to scatter her pearls
test1350,the princess was distracted and did not know what to do she felt she had sent against kitty
test1351,well doctor decide our fate say the princess tell me everything
test1352,is there hope she meant to say but her lips swifted and she could not out the question doctor
test1353,as you please the princess went out with a sigh
test1354,the family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his observations
test1355,and there are indications of malnutrition nervous excitability and so on
test1356,the question asks thus in presence of indications of tuberculosis process what is to be done to maintain nutrition
test1357,"yes, that's an understood thing responded to the celebrated physician again glancing it as watch"
test1358,begging the yosie's road was yet or shall i drive around
test1359,he asked ah it is
test1360,"oh well, i can then do it in twenty minutes"
test1361,and how about a tour around the world asked the family doctor
test1362,what is wanted is the means of improving nutrition and not for lowering it
test1363,the family doctor listened attentively and respectfully
test1364,but in favor of foreign travel i would urge the change of habits in the removal of conditions calling up remembrance
test1365,and then the mother wishes it it
test1366,ah well in that case to be in the case to be let them go only those grecian's are mischievous
test1367,oh time's up now he went to the door
test1368,the celebrated doctor announced to the princess a feeling of what was done from him dictated his doing so that he ought to see the patient once more
test1369,oh no only a few details princess come this way
test1370,and the mother accompanied by the doctor went into the room for kitty
test1371,the doctor came in she flushed crone and her eyes filled with tears
test1372,she answered him and all at once got up furious
test1373,"excuse me doctor, but there is no really object in this"
test1374,this is the third time you've asked me the same thing
test1375,the celebrated doctor did not take off the fence
test1376,nervous eritability he said to the princess when kitty had left the room however i had finished
test1377,and the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess as an exceptionally intelligent woman the condition of the young woman and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters which were certainly harmful
test1378,at the question should they go out to go into deep meditation as though resolving a weighty problem
test1379,finally his decision was pronounced they were to go abroad but to put no faith in foreign quacks and to apply to him in any need
test1380,it seemed as if some piece of good fortune had come to come after the doctor had gone
test1381,the mother was much more cheerful when she went back to her daughter and kitty pretended to be more cheerful
test1382,educated people of the upper classes are trying to stilt the ever growing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social order
test1383,this is absolutely incorrect
test1384,in the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interests for the interest of the group
test1385,the champions of the social conception of life usually try to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea of moral influence but this connection is quite impossible
test1386,the man who is controlled by moral influence acts in accordance with his own desires
test1387,the basis of authority is bodily violence
test1388,the possibility of applying bodily violence to people is provided above by an organization of armed men trained to act in unison and submission to one will
test1389,these bands of armed men submission to a single will are what constitute the army
test1390,the army has always been and still is the basis of power
test1391,power is always in the hands of those who control the army and an man in power from the roman cesars to the russian and german empires take more interest in their army than in anything and popularity in the army knowing that if that is on their side their power is secure
test1392,indeed it could not be otherwise
test1393,only under those conditions could the social organization be justified
test1394,but as this is not the case and on the contrary men in power are always far from being saints through the very fact of their possession of power the social organization based on power has no justification
test1395,even if there was once a time when oing to the low standards of morals and the disposition of men to violence the existence of an authority to restrain such violence was an advantage because the violence of the government was less than the violence of individuals one cannot but see that this advantage could not be lasting
test1396,between the members of one state subject to a single authority the strike between the individuals seemed still less and the life of the state seems even more secure
test1397,it was produced on one hand by the natural growth of population and on the other by struggle and conquest
test1398,after conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to internal divisions and so the state conception of life justifies itself
test1399,but this justification is never more than temporary
test1400,internal disceptions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression exerted by the authority over the disentientian individuals
test1401,government authority even if it suppresses private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the government
test1402,and therefore the oppression of the oppressed always goes on growing up to the farthest limit beyond which it cannot go without killing the goose with the golden eggs
test1403,the most convincing example of this is to be found in the condition of the classes of our era who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient time subbed by conquest
test1404,so it has been
test1405, footnote the fact that in america the bees of authority exist in spite of the small number of their troops not only fails to disprove this position but positively confirms it
test1406,the upper classes know that an army of fifty thousand will soon be insufficient and no longer relying on pinkton's men they think that the security of their position depends on the increased strength of the army
test1407,the reason to which he gave expression is essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the pope's engaged swit and scot guards and makes the russians of the center districts and the regimes from the center are stationed in central districts and the regimes from the center are stationed on the borders
test1408,the meaning of kaper's speech put into plain language is that is needs are needed not to resist foreign enemies but to under officers to be ready to act against the slave toiling masses
test1409,and this abnormal order of thanks is maintained by the army
test1410,but there is not only one government there are other governments exploiting their subjects by violence in the same way and are always ready to pounce down on any other government and carry off the fruits of the slave subjects
test1411,and so every government needs an army also to protect its buttoy from its brigins
test1412,this increase is contaminated as montsouque pointed out a hundred and fifty years ago
test1413,every increase in the army of one state with the aim of self defense against its subjects becomes a source of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies
test1414,the despotism of a government always increases with the strength of the army and its external successes and the aggression of a government increases with its internal despotism
test1415,the rivalry of the european states in constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse to universal military service because by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers is obtained at the least possible expense
test1416,and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the inequalities practiced upon them all citizens have become their own impressors
test1417,this inconsistency has become obvious in universal military service
test1418,in fact the whole significance of the social conception of life consists in man's recognition of the barbarity of struggle between individuals and the transitoryness of personal life itself and the transfer of the aim of life the groups of people
test1419,but with universal military service it comes to past that men after every sacrifice to get back from the cruelty of strike and the insecurity of existence are called upon to face all the perils they had meant to avoid
test1420,but instead of doing it they exposed the individuals to the same necessity of strike substituting strie with individuals of other states for strie with neighbors
test1421,the taxes were raised from the people for war preparations absorb the greater part of the products of labor which the army should defend
test1422,the danger of war ever ready to break out gives all reforms of life social life vain and flautless
test1423,but the fatal significance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent in the social communication of life is not only apparent in that
test1424,government asserts that armies are needed above all for external defense but that is not true
test1425,they are needed primarily against their subjects and every man under universal military service becomes an companion in all the acts of violence of the government against the citizens without any choice of his own
test1426,and for the sake of what am i making
test1427,i'm expected for the sake of a state to make these sacrifices to remove everything that can be precious to man peace family security and human dignity
test1428,except for the state they say we should be exposed to the attacks of evil disposed people in our own country
test1429,we now know that threats and punishments cannot reduce their number that can only be done by change of environment and moral influence
test1430,so that the justification of state violence on the ground of the protection that gives us from evil disposed people even if it had any foundation three or three centuries ago has none ever now
test1431,except for the state they tell us we should not have any religion education culture means of communication and so
test1432,without the state men would not have been able to form the social institutions needed for doing anything
test1433,this argument too was well founded only some centuries ago
test1434,the great extension of means of communication and intersection of ideas has made me completely able to dispense with state aid in informing societies associations corporations and congresses for scientific economic and political objects
test1435,without governments nations would be enslaved by their neighbors
test1436,the government they tell us with its army it is necessary to defend us from neighboring states that might slaves us
test1437,and if defense against barbarian nations is meant one thousand part of the troops now under arms would be ample enough for that purpose
test1438,the power of the state far from being a security against the attacks of our neighbors exposes us on the contrary to much greater danger of such attacks
test1439,even looking at it practically wang that is to say all the burdened on him by the state no man can fail to see that for him personally to comply with the state demands and serve in the army would in the majority of cases be more disadvantageous than to refuse to do so
test1440,to resist would need independent thought and effort of which every man is able
test1441,so much for the advantages and disadvantages of both lines of conduct for a man of a wealthy class an oppressor
test1442,for a man of the poor class the advantages and disadvantages will be the same but with a great increase of disadvantages
test1443,say you know something
test1444,chris looked from a nickel plated flashlight to a car jack and spark plug.
test1445,no one who needs a job ban that's jaky aris
test1446,okay you said
test1447,only why did you ask him yourself
test1448,mike became easy and fished it in an elastic band out of his pocket made a flip of paper and sent it soring out into em street
test1449,well he admitted i did
test1450,chris asked for the first time that day the heavy weight he carried within him lifted and lightened a little
test1451,he thinks he really needs it he pursued
test1452,he would have to like to get the job for jakie who needed it but perhaps the task of facing mister wiker especially now that the light was going and dusk edged into the streets was not what chris had intended for ending the afternoon
test1453,mike's expression changed to what once to one of triumph but grisson was only partially encouraged
test1454,i think you're going after all it's turn into him
test1455,mike was standing on the corner
test1456,oh shucks
test1457,chris started off once more passing a bleak little victorian church perched on the hill above mister worker's house
test1458,an empty lot cut into by church lane gave a look of isolation to the a shape of brick building that served mister wiker's both house and place at place of business
test1459,the longer wing towards the back got a door that opened on a water street the space between the house in washington avenue had been made into a neat oblong flower garden fenced off from the side by box rugs in the white picket fence
test1460,a liven yellow stain the horizon beyond the factories and glay clouds lower and tumbed above
test1461,the air was growing chill and chris decided to finish the job
test1462,all at once you wondered how his mother was and everything in him and in him pinched and tightened itself
test1463,at the foot of the hill he reached the house
test1464,there were three things that always caught his eye ahead of the litter of dusty pieces
test1465,on the left the coil of rope in the center the model of a sailing ship in a green glass bottle and on the right the wooden statue of a negro boy in baggy trousers and turban
test1466,but the name still showed at the prou and many a time chris safe in home and bed had sailed imaginary voyages in the mirror bell
test1467,he had never seen anyone go into mister worker's shop. now he thought of it.
test1468,how then did he live and what did he ever sell?
test1469,a sudden car horn walking from the dream
test1470,of many times he was examined by mr. mr.'s window and poured over the rope the ship and the nubian boy he had never gone into mr. mr's shop
test1471,so now alone until someone should answer the bell they looked eagerly if not easily around him
test1472,what with the one window in the lower in day outside the long long shop was somber
test1473,heavy handued beams crossed it from one side to the other
test1474,the mister's back being towards the source of light chris could not see his face
test1475,the double fans and minute rinkings breaking from eye corner to temple and joining with those over the cheeks were drawn into the horizontal lines across the domed front
test1476,little tuffs of white fuz above the ears were all that remained of the antiquary's hair but what drew and held chris's gaze were the old man's eyes
test1477,chris blinked and looked again yes they were still there
test1478,chris swallowed and his voice came back to him
test1479,"yes, sir, you said"
test1480,i saw your sign and i know a boy who needs the job.
test1481,he's a school made of mine
test1482,"jakey harris's name is, and he really needs the job"
test1483,i i i was wondering if the place was still open
test1484,what he saw was a fresh cheeked lad tall for thirteen sturdy with sincerity and good humor in his face and something sensitive and appealing about his eyes
test1485,he guesses there must be a lively fire in that beyond
test1486,would that interfere with jakey's getting the job sir
test1487,but even as he slowly turned the thought pierced his mind why had he not seen the reflection of the headlights of the cars moving up around the corner of wall under street not the hill towards the dictional signals
test1488,the room seemed overly still
test1489,then in that second he turned and faced about
test1490,the waid bow window was there before him and three objects he liked showing frosty in the moonlight that poured into from across the water
test1491,across the water where was the free way
test1492,it was no longer there nor were the high walls and smoke stacks of factories to be seen
test1493,the warehouses were still there.
test1494,flabagged and breathless chris was unaware that he had moved closer to appear out of the window in every direction
test1495,no electric signs no lampled streets
test1496,where the people's drug store had stood but half an hour before rose the walls of which was evidently an in
test1497,a courtroom was first laid by flaring torture to showing a swinging sign hanging on a post
test1498,the post was planted at the edge of it was now a broad and money road
test1499,a coach with its top pilled high with luggage stamped to a halt beside the flag courtyard
test1500,they moved into the in the inn the coach driver rattled off to the stable
test1501,my window has a power for those few who are to see
test1502,the learning of magic was by no means easy
test1503,he told his master at once about simon gostler his herd of money and his hiding places for it
test1504,chris therefore threw himself into all the primaries of his task
test1505,one afternoon when he had returned after arrest to mister worker's study he saw that there was something new in the room a bowl with a gold fish in it it stood on the table but mister worker is not to be seen
test1506,what do i do first?
test1507,how you've improved my boy it exclaimed is there is now a time for you to try this is this is to change as any
test1508,suppose i change and can't change back
test1509,mr. worker waited patiently beside him for a few moments for chris to get up his courage
test1510,then there is nothing happening with a voice like a whisper mister. mister said start it once
test1511,a sensation spread faster and faster
test1512,his head swapped and he felt faint and a little sick but he resisted through the final words
test1513,he thought not without a feeling of pride and began experimenting with his tail and fins with such enthusiasm and delight that some little time elaped before mister worker's voice boom but by by
test1514, seventy four book one the return
test1515,the figure shoes carved in some eastern style at curved down pointing toes
test1516,then all that once the idea came to chris
test1517,if he was to be a magician could he make this come to life
test1518,he squed on his hones examined the carved wood and figure attendently and felt convinced that once alive the boy would be an ideal and happy companion
test1519,but how did one a change inanimate to animate
test1520,chris got up and stole back to mister worker's door
test1521,you heard that magician going up the spiral staircase to his room above and after changing himself to a mouse to slip under the door and see that the room was really empty mister doo's proper shape and open the doors of the cupboard at the far end of the room
test1522,the afternoon rainy before increased in storm
test1523,thus came two hours before its time thunder snare in the sky
test1524,certain elements were to be mixed and poured at the proper time
test1525,mr. worker began moving about upstairs the boards creaked creaking and still chris could not leave until the fountain fumed and glowed
test1526,with infinite caution chris closed the doors silently behind him and running lightly forward reach the figure of the negro boy
test1527,it was as if the stiffness melted
test1528,under his eyes wetting hands of cloth became rich silk embroidery glimmered in its reality upon the coat and oh the face
test1529,the wooden grin loosened the large eyes turned the hand holding the hard boko of carved flowers moved then that the boko fall
test1530,they went down to their quarters first
test1531,gust mister finny went to his quarters i don't remember seeing him cross the deck or come over over that way at all
test1532,next ned silly was being brought to the head by elbert jones who took over ned went on down
test1533,it looks to me as if it could have been one of several people and i'll be switched if i know who i'll keep my eyes open
test1534,the mirror bell was nearing thaeithi
test1535,we've water in fresh stores to tick on there
test1536,chris lost no time as soon as he could do it without being noticed in hurrying down to his cabin
test1537, certainly my boy boomed up the captain's blue eyes suddenly my boy boomed up the captain's blue eyes abruptly keen in penetrating
test1538,mister finnin will be some time on deck we cannot be any other heard in here
test1539,his face rose with nervousness that this might not do as an answer and he stood stiff and still before captain lizard
test1540,the captain sat forward in his chair looking at him for a long moment considering
test1541,then he said well i do not care for it i cannot say i do
test1542,this ship is more to me than wife or mother or family
test1543,and paused fingering his lower lip looking sideways in a reflective fashion at chris standing before him
test1544,"we will say no more, but i trust you understand the responsibility you have."
test1545,the ship its cargo and its men will be in your hands
test1546,yes sir i think i can do it safely or i should not try sir
test1547,captain blizzards round pink face crased in its winning smile
test1548,he then went on to describe what else was to follow the covering of the ship with leaves to make it blend with its surroundings
test1549,camouflage was not a word the captain or any one of his time you had understood
test1550,what can be said during that time time sir chris did not ask
test1551,i am somewhat skilled in medications i have to be as a captain of the ship and the crew know it
test1552,i shall say that you are in my own cabin so that i can care for you
test1553,not since he had left mister waker and chris felt such confidence as he did in the words and actions of captain blister
test1554,he knew now that his absence for as long as he had to be away would be covered up and satisfyingly accounted for
test1555,their conversation had taken some little while
test1556,on churchyard's yon
test1557,i knew well enough that he might be carried thousands of miles in the box car locked in perhaps without water or food
test1558,i am sure i kissed lady and i've had terrible moments since when i seem to remember kissing mr. jamesson too in the excitement
test1559,"fortunately, warner on the detective were keeping bachelor hall in the lodge"
test1560,out of defense to leyie they washed their dishes once a day and a concoted queer messes according to their several abilities
test1561,miss ines he said stopping me as i was about to go to my room upstairs how are your nerves tonight
test1562,i have none i said happily
test1563,i mean he persisted do you feel as if you could go through with something rather unusual
test1564,the most unusual thing i can think of would be a peaceful night
test1565,something is going to occur he said
test1566,put on heavy shoes and some all dark clothes and make up your mind not to be surprised at anything
test1567,lina was sleeping of the sleep of the just when i went up stairs and i hunted out my things cautiously
test1568,they were shaking confidently together but when i came down they ceased
test1569,there were a few preparations to be made the locks to be gone over winter's to be instructed as renewed vigilance and then after destroying the whole light we crapped in the darkness through the front door and into the night
test1570,i ask no questions
test1571,once only somebody spoke and then it was an enigmatic with a profanity from doctor steard when he run into a wire fence
test1572,i only know what i expected
test1573,the doctor was puffing somewhat where we finally came to a halt
test1574,i confess that just at that minute even sunny side seemed a cheerful spot
test1575,in spite of myself i drew my breathing sharply
test1576,it was alex armed with two long handled spades
test1577,the doctor kept a keen lookout but no one appeared
test1578,there is one thing sure i'll not be suspected of completeness
test1579,a doctor is generally supposed to be a handyman at bearing folks than a tigging them up
test1580,i held on to him frantically and somehow i got tare and looked down
test1581,but how am i to get over the ten or twelve days that yet must elapse before they go
test1582,for for none could endure me as he has done oh
test1583,the word stares me in the face like a guilty confession but it is true i hate him i hate him
test1584,i sometimes think i should give him credit for the good feeling he simulated so well and then again i think it is my duty to suspect him under the peculiar circumstances in which i am placed
test1585,i have done well to record them quickly
test1586,they have been taken themselves to their work i less divert my mind than to duplicate conversations i provided myself with the book
test1587,i is too well well known with your character and conduct to feel any real friendship for you and i am without your talent for the simulation i cannot assume the appearance of it
test1588,on pressing this she turned carlton and beat her lip
test1589,you may go millean until following a while millean point
test1590,ollie blame me elen continue she
test1591,hah you are suspicious
test1592,if i were suspicious i replied i should have discovered your infinite long before
test1593,i enjoy human length ramble as well as you i answered steadily fixing my eyes up on her and francey happens to be one of my favorite resorts
test1594,she colored again excessively and remained silent pressing her finger against her cheek and gazing into the fire
test1595,i watch her a few moments to the feeling of malvolent gratification then moving towards the door i calmly asked if she had anything more to say
test1596,yes yes
test1597,suppose i do
test1598,she paused in evident disconsent and perplexity mingled with anger she do not show
test1599,i can't renounce what is more than life she mitted in a low harry tone
test1600,if you are generous here is a fitting opportunity for the exercise of your magnanimity if you are proud here am i your opponent rather to acknowledge myself your adpter for an act of the most noble forfearings
test1601,i shall not tell him
test1602,give me no thanks it is not for your sector i refrained
test1603,and melissa will you tell her
test1604,i will not for much that you should know infinity and disgrace of relation
test1605,you use hard words missus huntington's but i can pardon you
test1606,how dare you mention his name to me
test1607,it seems very interesting love said he lifting his head and turning to where his eye saw the tooth ringing my hand in silent rage and anger but it's rather long i look at it some other time and meanwhile i'll travel for you my dear what keys
test1608,the keys of your cabinet desk drawing and whatever else you have said he rise and holding out his hand
test1609,the key of my desk in fact was at that moment in the lock and the others were attached to it
test1610,now then sneered he we must have a confinement of property
test1611,and putting the keys into his pocket he walked into the library
test1612,that and all replied the master and the things were cleared away
test1613,mr. huntington then went up stairs
test1614,norton he is starting back she's very devil for spite
test1615,i didn't say i had broken it did i return him
test1616,i shall put you up in a small monthly allow in future for your own private expenses and you'll not even trouble yourself any more about my concerns i shall look out for a steader my dear i'll not expose you to the temptation
test1617,and as for the household matters missus crips must be very particular in keeping her account we must go up a entirely new plan
test1618,what great discovery have you now mister houndin
test1619,i have attempted to defraud you
test1620,not in money matters exactly it seems but it is better to keep out of the way of temptation
test1621,here benson entered the candles and there followed the brief interval of silence i sitting still in my chair and he is standing with his back to the fire silently trying thing in my despair
test1622,i know that day after day such feelings return on me
test1623,i try to look to him and raise my heart to heaven but it will cliffe to the dust
test1624,then hope i fear
test1625,mister and mister mister mister mister mister mister mister mister mister mister mister mister miter and mister mister ester either there or here
test1626,no unless you can tell me what you want to expect him home
test1627,i can't he doesn't want him do you
test1628,it is a resolution you are performed long ago
test1629,we all have a bit of a liking for him at the bottom of our hearts though we can't respect him
test1630,no i'd rather be like myself that as i am
test1631,never mind my plain speaking said i it is from the best motivations
test1632,but tell me should you wish your sons to be like mister huntington or even like yourself
test1633,oh no i could understand that
test1634,fire and fury
test1635,now don't force into a terror at the head
test1636,but hang it's not my fault
test1637,not years for for she is only five and twenty
test1638,what would you make of me and the children to be sure that were hurt death between them
test1639,i know they are blessed them
test1640,it followed me into the library
test1641,i thought outton put into his hands two of malison's letters one was from london and written during one of his whole world's seasons of reckless dissipation the other in the country during a quiet interval
test1642,the former was full of trouble and anger not accusing him but deeply regretting his connection with his profligate companions abusing mister grimsby and others insinuating bitter things against mister huntington and most ingeniously throwing the blame of her husband's misconduct on the other man's shoulders
test1643,i've been a cursed rascal god knows said he as he gave it a harsh squeeze but you see if i don't make a man for it then me if i don't make for it then me if i don't
test1644,if you intend to reform invoke god's blessing is mercy in this aid not its curse
test1645,god help me then for i'm sure i need it
test1646,where is milison
test1647,nay not i said he turning around and pushing it towards me
test1648,milson's flight to thank me overwhelming its gratitude
test1649,cried she i couldn't have influenced him i was sure by anything that i could have said
test1650,you never tried me mily said he
test1651,after that they would prepare to their country home
test1652,captain league did not look at all like the london dandy now.
test1653,there was a very natural savagery and rejection there and a wild leer in his yellow eyes rachel sat down.
test1654,a slave only think a slave
test1655,"oh frightful, frightful is it a dream?"
test1656,"oh, frightful, frightful."
test1657,stanley stanley it would be mercy to kill me she broke her again.
test1658,bright and natty in the jin's curtains and the little bathroom set out not in elegantly and her pet piping gold french asleep on his perch with a bit of sugar between the wires of her cage her pillow so white and unpressed with its little edges of lace
test1659,when he came back to the drawing room a toilet bottle of over the clonon in his hand with her lase handkerchief he bathed her temples in front of head
test1660,there was nothing very brotherly in his look as he pured into a pale sharp features during the process.
test1661,there don't mind me she said sharply and getting up she looked down at her dress and thin shoes and seeming to recall herself she took the candle he had just set down and went quickly to her room
test1662,and she threw back her wail and going quickly to the toilet mechanically surveyed herself in the glass
test1663,rachel leek rachel leek what are you now?
test1664,i'll stay here that is in the drawing room she answered and the face was withdrawn.
test1665,he slank a space and tapped sharply at the little window of the maddest post office at which the young ladies in the pony carriage had pulled up the day before and within which luke waggat was warned to sleep in a sort of wooden box that folded up and appeared to be a chest of drawers all day.
test1666,look took care of mr. lucan's dogs and groomed mr. wilder's horse and cleaned up his dog cart for mark being clothes about money and finding that the thing was to be done cheaper that way put up his horse and dog cart in the post office premises and so avoided the delivery charges of the branden arms
test1667,but luke was not there and captain lake recalling his habits and his hound hurried on on to the silver lion which has its cable towards the common only about a hundred steps away for distances are not great in jylingland
test1668,here where the flow of soul and of stout long pipes long yarns and tolerable long credits and the humble gape crases of the town resort to thier for the pleasures of a club life and often revelled deep into the small hours of the morning
test1669,no lose time and i'll give you half a crown.
test1670,luke stoke's hair is greasy wide awake and in a few minutes more the door cut was stunned out into the lane and the horse hense went between the sheets with that wonderful cheerfulness with which they bear to be called up under staring circumstances at unseasonable hours
test1671,if i thought you would fail me now to me i should never come back good night to me.
test1672,the act said that in case of difference of opinion there must be a ballot
test1673,he went up to the table and striking it with his finger ring he shouted loudly a ball
test1674,he was shouting for the very coarse syrius evanio's had proposed but it was evident that he hated him and all his party and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and roused in opposition to it the sameindictingness though in a more seemingly form on the other side
test1675,shouts were raised and for a moment all was confusion so that the marshal of the province had to call for order a ballot
test1676,we shed our blood for our country.
test1677,the confidence of the monarch no checking the accounts of the marshall he is not a casher but that's not the point
test1678,voting please be easy
test1679,they express the most implacable hatred
test1680,living did not in the least understand what was a matter and he marveled at the passion with which it was disputed whether or not the decision about flare of should be put to the vote
test1681,he forgot as sir jevinevich explained to him afterwards this syllogism that it was necessary for the public good to get out of the marshal of the province that to get out of the marshal it was necessary to have a majority of votes that to get a majority of votes it was necessary to have a majority of votes
test1682,but levin forgot all that and it was painful to him to see all these excellent people for whom he had a respect in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement
test1683,to escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the workers at the freshening bar
test1684,he particularly liked the one gray whistled worker who showed his corn for the other younger ones and was jared at by them was teaching them how to fold up napkins properly
test1685,living advanced but utterly forgetting what he was to do and much embarrassed he turned to sylvia evenings with the question where am i to put it
test1686,so you are even a little brown
test1687,that is a matter for each person's decision he said severely
test1688,having put it in him he reflected that he should have thrusted his left hand too and so he thrusted him though too late and still more overcome with confusion he beat a hasty retreat into the background
test1689,a hundred and twenty six for admission ninety eight against
test1690,sang for the voice of the secretary who could not pronounce the letter a
test1691,then there was a laugh a button and two notes were found in the box
test1692,but the old party did not consider themselves conquered.
test1693,in reply snetcoff spoke of the trust the noblemen of the province had placed in him the effect they had shown him which he did not deserve as his only merit had been his attachment to the nobility to whom he had devoted twelve years of service
test1694,this expression in the marshall's face was particularly touching to leven because only the day for he had been at his house about his trusted business and had seen him in all his grandeur a kindhearted father man
test1695,if there are men younger and more deserving than i let them serve
test1696,and the marshall disappeared through a side door
test1697,they were to proceed immediately to the election
test1698,two noble gentlemen who had a weakness for strong drink had been made drunk by the parties of snetcov and a third had been robbed of his uniform
test1699,on learning this the new party had made haste during the dispute about flareoff to send some of their men in a sling to clothes the stripped gentlemen and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting
test1700,levin did not care to eat and he was not smoking he did not want to join his own friends that is sirse evingin stepan arkudvies sivsky and the rest because bronson in the inquary's uniform was standing with them in eager conversation
test1701,he went to the window and sat down scanning the groups and listening to what was being said around him
test1702,he's such a black god
test1703,i have told him so but it makes no difference only think of it
test1704,these people were unknowingly seeking a place where they could talk without being overheard
test1705,shall we go on your excellence fine champagne
test1706,last year at our district marshall nicael evanine's
test1707,oh still just the same always at a loss the land owner answered with a resigned smile but with an expression of serenity and conviction that so it must be
test1708,why what is there to understand?
test1709,there is no meaning in it at all
test1710,then two one must keep up connections
test1711,it's a moral obligation of an assault
test1712,and then to tell the truth there's one's own interests
test1713,they are proprietors of a sort but we are the land owners
test1714,that it may be but still it should be treated a little more respectfully
test1715,if we are laying out a garden planning one before the house you know and there you have a tree that stood with centuries in the very spot old and nalled it may be and yet you don't cut down the old fellow to make room for the flower beds but lay out your beds so as to take advantage of the tree
test1716,well and how is your land doing
test1717,but one's work is thrown in for nothing
test1718,"oh well, one does it what would you have"
test1719,and more the landowner went on leaning his elbows in the window and chatting on my son i must tell you has no taste for it
test1720,so there will be no one to keep it up and yet one does it
test1721,we walked about the fields and the garden no sara shaheh onstam missus levich everything's well looked after but your gardens lacked
test1722,to my thinking i'd cut down that line
test1723,here you have thousands of limes and each would make two good bundles of bark
test1724,you're married i heard said the landowner
test1725,"yes, it's rather strange he went on"
test1726,the landowner chuckled under his white moustaches
test1727,why don't we cut down our parks for tibet?
test1728,said eleven returning to a thought the rads struck him
test1729,there is a class instinct too of what one ought and ought not to do
test1730,there's the peasants too i wonder at them sometimes any good peasant tries to take all the land he can
test1731,without a return to any simple loss
test1732,when he came from the bath proclas visited him again
test1733,but harman was not in the mood to share a joyous reveal and he frankly said so although immediately after his return he had accepted the invitation to the festival which the whole fellowship of artists would give the following day in honor of the seventyth birthday of the old sculptor fuerner
test1734,she would appear herself at dessert and the banquet must therefore begin at an unusual early hour
test1735,so the artist found himself obliged to relink his opposition
test1736,the banquet was to begin in a few hours yet he could not let the day pass without seeing daphne and telling her the words of the oracle
test1737,he longed with ardent yurning for the sound of her voice and still more to unburden his sorely troubled soul to her
test1738,since his return from the oracle the fear that the rescue demeter might yet be the work of mertis might yet be the work of mertis had again mastered him
test1739,the approval as well as the doubts which had arisen in others strengthened his opinion although even now he could not succeed in bringing it into harmony with the facts
test1740,then he went directly to the neighboring palace the queen might have appeared already and it would not do to keep her waiting
test1741,hithere the merchant had been induced it is true to advance large sums of money to the queen but the loyal devotion which he showed to her royal husband had rendered it impossible to give him even a hint of the conspiracy
test1742,when herman entered the residents of the gramematias in the palace the guests had already assembled
test1743,the place by harmon's side which althea had chosen for herself would then be given up to arsenal
test1744,"true an interesting conversation still had power to charm him but often during its continuation the full consciousness of his misfortune forced itself upon his mind for the majority of the subjects discussed by the artists came to them through the medium of sight and referred to new creations of architecture, sculpture and painting from which the enjoyment of their blindness brought him"
test1745,a stranger out of his own sphere he fell chilled among these closely united men and women to whom no tye bound him save the presence of the same host
test1746,crats had really been invited in order to win him over to the queen's cause and charming fair harred nikie had been commissioned by the conspirators to persuade him to sing arson's prizes among his professional associates
test1747,his son had been the royal dama's first husband and she had desided him to marry lucasas the aged king of threas
test1748,the king's sister the object of his love cried harmon and credulously
test1749,we woman are only as old as we look and the leeches' entire woman of this beauty of forty practice arts which give her the appearance of twenty five yet perhaps the king's value his intelligence more than her person and the wisdom of a hundred snakes is certainly united in this woman's head
test1750,the three most trustworthy one's are here ammonus the leech crispus and the admirable proclas
test1751,let us hope that you will make this three leaved clover the luck promising four leaved one
test1752,your uncle two has often with praise worthy generosity helped as in many embarrassment
test1753,how long he kept you waiting from the first word concerning a work which justly transported the whole city with delight
test1754,when he did finally summon you he said things which must have warned you
test1755,that is going to far replied harmon
test1756,he winked at her and made a significant gesture as he spoke and then informed the blind artist how graciously arnort had remembered him when she heard of the remedy by whom many a wonderful cure of blind eye had been made in roads
test1757,the royal lady had inquired about him and his sufferings with almost sisterly interest and althea eagerly confirmed the statement
test1758,her mother listened to the parent's silence
test1759,the rodman was just beginning to praise arnson also as a special friend and consoner of the sculpture's art when crates her fellow student asked the blind artist in behalf of his beautiful companion why his demetra was placed upon a petadolwich to others as well as himself seemed too high for the size of the statue
test1760,yet what mattered it even if these miserable people considered themselves deceived and pointed the finger of scorn at him
test1761,a woman who years for the regard of all men and makes love to a toy easily lessens the demands she imposes upon individuals
test1762,only even though love has entirely disappeared she still claims consideration and althea did not wish to lose harmon's regard
test1763,how indifferent you look but i tell you her deep blue eyes flashed as she spoke that so long as you were still a genuine creating artist the case was different
test1764,though so loud a denial is written on your face i persist in my conviction and that no idle delusion and snas me i can prove
test1765,it was nay it could have been nothing else that very spider
test1766,not a sound if you value your lives
test1767,to offer resistance would have been madness for even harmon perceived by the loud clanking of weapons around them the greatly superior power of the enemy and they were acting by the orders of the king to the prison near the place of execution
test1768,was he to be led to the executioners block
test1769,what pleasure had life to life for him the blind man who was already dead to his art
test1770,are he not to greet his sudden end as a boom from the mortals?
test1771,did it not spare him a humiliation as great and painful as could be imagined
test1772,whatever might await him he desired no better fate
test1773,if he had passed into annihilation he hermon wished to follow him thither and annihilation certainly meant redemption from pain and misery
test1774,but if they were destined to meet his meritous and his mother in the world beyond the grave what had he not to tell them how sure he was of finding a joyful reception there from both
test1775,the power which delivered him over to death just at that moment was not nemesis no it was a kindly deity
test1776,but yet it was no illusion that deceived him
test1777,again he heard the beloved voice and this time it addressed not only him but with the most haste the commander of the soldiers
test1778,sometimes with touching and treaty sometimes with imperial command she protested after giving him her name that this matter could be nothing but an unfortunate mistake
test1779,lastly with ernest warmness she beasted him before taking the prisoners away to permit her to speak to the commanding general philippus her father's guest who she was sure was in the palace
test1780,cried harmon in great agitation but she would not listen to him and follow the soldier whom the captain detail to guide her into the palace
test1781,today you will confess to me who treacherously directed you to this dangerous path
test1782,daffy again pleaded for the liberation of the prisoners but philip's silence charge with the grave exclamation the order of the king
test1783,as soon as the captive artist was alone with the woman he loved he clasped her hand pouring forth in coherent words of the most ardent gratitude and when he felt her warmly return the pressure he could not restrain the desire to clasp her to his heart
test1784,in spite of his deep mental distress he could have shouted in loud in his delight and gratitude
test1785,he might now have been permitted to bind forever to his life the woman who had just rescued him from the greatest danger but the confession he must make to his fellow artists in the plustle the following morning still sealed his lips yet in this hour he felt that he was united to her and ought to conceal what awaited him so obeying a strong impulse he exclaimed you know that i love you
test1786,i love you and have loved you always
test1787,danny exclaimed tenderly what more is needed
test1788,but harmon with druping head murmured tomorrow i shall no longer be what i am now
test1789,then daphne raised his face to his asking so the demeter is the work of meritals
test1790,what a terrible ordeal again awaits you
test1791,and i fool blind also in my mind could be vexed with you for it
test1792,bring this before your mind and everything else that you must accept with it if you consent when the time arrives to become mine conceal in palya nothing
test1793,so kaya intended to leave the city on one of his own ships that very day
test1794,he himself on the way to expose himself to the malice and mockery of the whole city
test1795,his heart contracted painfully and his request about his uncle's fate increased when philippus informed him that the conspirators had been arrested at the banquet and headed by amemetes the rodian crispsus and procales had died by the executioner's sword at sun rise
test1796,besides he knew that the object of his love would not part from him without granting him one last word
test1797,on the way his heart throbbed almost to bursting
test1798,even daphne's image and what threatened her father and her with him went far into the background
test1799,he was appearing before his companions only to give truth it's just do
test1800,the egyptian obeyed and his master crossed the wide space strewed with sand and approached the stage which had been erected for the festive performances even had his eyes retain the power of sight his blood was crossing so widely through his veins that he might perhaps have been able to distinguish the statues around him and the thousands of spectators who crowded closely together richly garlanded their faces
test1801,shouted his friend sarita and joyful surprise in the midst of his painful walk hamon
test1802,even while he believed himself to be the creator of the demeter he had been seriously troubled by the praise of so many critics because it had exposed him to the suspicion of having become faithless to his art and his nature
test1803,honor to murtel and his art but he trusted the noble feasle assembly would pardon the unintentional deception and gave his prayer for recovery
test1804,afterward it was supposed that he was satisfied with a blood of oxen lamps and doves and that in exchange for or in account of these sacrifices this god gave rain sunshine and harvest
test1805,whether he was the creator of yourself and myself
test1806,whether and the prayer was ever answered
test1807,why did he create the intellectual inferior
test1808,why did he create the deformed and helpless why did he create the criminal the idiotic the insane
test1809,are the failures and obligation to their creator
test1810,is he responsible for all the wars that have been waged for all the innocent blood that has been shed
test1811,is he responsible for the centuries of slavery for the backs that have been scared with a lash for the babies that have been sold from the breasts of mothers for the families that have been separated and destroyed
test1812,is this god responsible for religious persecution for the inquisition for the tumbs screw and rack and for all the instruments of torture
test1813,did this got allowed the cruel and vile to destroy the brave and virtuous
test1814,did he allow tyrants to shad the blood of patriots
test1815,can we conceive of a devil base enough to prefer his enemies to his friends
test1816,how can we account for the wild beasts that the war human beings for the fanged serpents whose bite is death
test1817,how can we account for a world where life feeds on life
test1818,did infinite wisdom intentionally produced the microscopic beasts that feed upon the optical nerve think of blinding a man to satisfy the appetite of a microbe
test1819,fear build the altar and offers the sacrifice
test1820,fear erased the cathedral and bows the head of man in worship
test1821,lit's religious and fearful tremblingly repeat his passage though he slays me yet will i trust him
test1822,can we say that he cared for the children of man
test1823,can we say that is mercy endured forever
test1824,do we prove his goodness by showing that he has opened the earth and swallowed thousands of his helpless children or that with the volcanoes he has overwhelmed them with rivers of fire
test1825,what was their goodness what was their wisdom in this
test1826,or the superior rise to sign cut that they are not the inferior
test1827,most people linked to the supernatural
test1828,if they give up one god they imagine an other
test1829,what is this power
test1830,man advances and necessarily advances to experience
test1831,a man wishing to go to a certain place comes to where the road divides
test1832,he has tried that road and knows that it is the wrong road
test1833,a child shown by the beauty of the flame grasped it with his dimpled hand
test1834,the power that works for righteousness had taught the child a lesson
test1835,it is a result.
test1836,it is insisted by these theologists and by many of the so called philosophers that this moral sense this sense of duty of responsibility was important and that conscience is an exotic
test1837,we live together in families tribes and nations
test1838,"they are praised, admired, and respected"
test1839,they are considered as good that is to say as moral
test1840,the members who add to the misery of the family the tribe of the nation are considered bad members
test1841,the greatest of human beings had said conscience is born of love
test1842,as people advance the remote consequences are perceived
test1843,the imagination is cultivated
test1844,a man puts himself in the place of another
test1845,the sense of duty becomes stronger more imperative
test1846,man judges himself
test1847,in all this there is nothing super natural
test1848,man has deceived himself
test1849,has christianity done good
test1850,when the church had control were men made better and happier
test1851,what has religion done for hungary or australia
test1852,could these countries have been worse without religion
test1853,could they have been worse had they had any other religion than christianity
test1854,what did christianity do for them
test1855,they hated pleasure
test1856,they muffled all the bells of gladness
test1857,the religion of the puritans was an unadultured curse
test1858,the puritans believe the bible to be the word of god and this belief has always made those who held it cruel and wretched
test1859,let me refer to just one fact showing the influence of a belief in the bible on human beings
test1860,the queen received the bible kissed it and pledged herself to diligently read therein
test1861,in other words it was just as fennish just as infamous as the catholic spirit
test1862,has the bible made the people of georgia kind and merciful
test1863, religion has been tried and in all countries in all times has failed
test1864, religion has always been the enemy of science of investigation and thought
test1865, religion has never made men free
test1866,it has never made man moral and temperable industrial and honest
test1867,are christian's more temperable nearer virtuous nearer honest than savages
test1868,can we cure disease by supplication
test1869,can we receive virtue or hane as arms
test1870, religion rests on the idea that nature has a master and that this master will listen to prayer that this master punishes and rewards that he loves praise and flattery and hates the brave and free
test1871,we must have corn the stones
test1872,the structure must have a basement
test1873,if we build we must begin at the bottom
test1874,i have a theory and i have four cornerstones
test1875,the first stone is that matter substance can't be destroyed can't be eliminated
test1876,if these cornerstones are facts it follows as a necessity that matter and force are from and to eternity that they can neither be increased or diminished
test1877,it follows that nothing has been or can be created that there never has been or can be a creation that there never has been or can be a creator
test1878,it follows that there could not have been any intelligence any design back of matter and force
test1879,i say what i think
test1880,every event has parents
test1881,that which has not happened could not
test1882,in the infinite chain there and can be no broken no missing link
test1883,we now know that our first parents were not foreigners
test1884,we now know if we know anything that the universe is natural and that men and women have been naturally produced
test1885,we know the parts that life has traveled
test1886,we know the footsteps of advance they have been traced
test1887,for thousands of years men and women have been trying to reform the world
test1888,why have the reformers failed
test1889,they depend on the lord on luck and charity
test1890,they live by fraud and violence and be quitted their vices to the children
test1891, failure seems to be the mark of nature why
test1892,nature produced without purpose sustained without intention and destroys without thought
test1893,must the world forever remain the victim of ignorant passion
test1894,why should men and women have children that they cannot take care of children that are a burden and curses why
test1895, passion is and always has been death
test1896,law can punish but it can neither reform criminals or prevent crime
test1897,this cannot be done by talk or example
test1898,this is the solution of the whole question
test1899,this freezes women
test1900,poverty and crime will be childless
test1901,it is far better to be free to leave the thoughts and barricades of fear to stand erect and face the future with a smile
test1902,there done for said the school master in a low key to the shette out with your vittarial and mind your eye
test1903,the two monsters took off their shoes and moved stealthily along keeping in the shadows of the houses
test1904,by means of this strategy they followed so closely that although within a few steps of sara and tom they did not hear them
test1905,sara and her brother having again passed by the tuppa frank arrived close to the dilated house which was partly in ruins and its open cells formed a kind of gulf along which the street ran in that direction
test1906,in an instant the school master with a leap resembling in strength and agility the spring of a tiger seized seated with one hand by the throat and exclaimed your money or i will fling you into this hole
test1907,no said the all brot drummingly no not one ring what a shame
test1908,tom tom sean did not lose his presence of mind during this scene rapidly and unexpectedly as it had occurred
test1909,"ooh, ah, to lay a trap to catches us replied the thief"
test1910,then addressing thomas seetan you know the plane of saint denny
test1911,did you see in the cabaret we had just left for i know you again the man whom the charman came to seek
test1912,cried the school master a thousand francs and i'll kill him
test1913,witch i do not see his life replied sara to the school master
test1914,let's go and meet him.
test1915,all by it it will be for looking after
test1916,well my wife will be there said the school master you will tell her what you want and i shall see
test1917,in the plane of saint saint.
test1918,between saint and the road of revolution at the end of the road agreed
test1919,he had forgotten the address of the self-style pan painter
test1920,the fiaac started
test1921, france who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the single fascination that this mysterious person seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to the single fascination that this mysterious person seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to the single fascination that this mysterious person seemed to exercise over him
test1922,my very good friend an excellent neighbor replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling expenses
test1923,my father the count of morse seff although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of france and madrid and i have hesitantly placed the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal
test1924,i can scarcely credit it
test1925,then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated
test1926,"shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour in quiet the count only let me warn you that i am preverbal for my punctilious exactness in keeping my engagements day for day hour for day, said albert that will suit me to a dot"
test1927,so be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards the calendar suspended near the chimney piece he said to day is the twenty first of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly half past ten hours now promised me to remember this and expect me the twenty first of may at the same hour in the forner
test1928,i reside in my father's house but occupy a pavilion at the farthest side of the courtyard and tile is separated from the main building
test1929,now then set the count returning his tablets to his pocket make yourself perfectly easy the hand of your time piece will not be more accurate in marking the time than yourself
test1930,that depends when do you leave?
test1931,for for france no for venice i shall remain in italy for another year or two
test1932,then we shall not meet in paris.
test1933,i fear i will not have that honor
test1934,well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young man allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey
test1935,what is the matter asked arbert of france when they had returned to their own apartments you seem more than commonly thought
test1936,i will confess to you albert replied france the count is a very single person and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand appreitions
test1937,did you ever meet him previously to coming thither?
test1938,upon my honor then listen to me
test1939,he dwelled with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificent of his entertainment in the broat of the thousand and one nights he recounted with circumstance and exactness all the particulars of the supper the hasehish the statues the dream and how at his awakening there were no proof of the trace of all these events except the small yard seen in the broat of the thousand and one nights
test1940,then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colonia between the count and vamper in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit pepino an engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled
test1941,"but said franc, the korean bandits that were among the crew of his vessel"
test1942,why really the thing seems to me simple enough.
test1943,talking of countries replied france of what countries the count is what is his native dong when does he derive his immense fortune and what were the events of his early life a life as marvelous as unknown that have tinned his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a meanthropy
test1944, certainly these are questions that in your place i should like to have answered.
test1945,my dear france replied abert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the count's assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend abert the morese is in danger helped me to deliver him
test1946,what are his means of existence what is his birthplace of what countries is he a native
test1947,i confess he asked me none no he merely came and freed me from the hands of senior vampire where i can assure you despite of all my outward appearance of ease and concern i did not very particularly care to remain
test1948,and this time it must be confessed to that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on the albert's side
test1949,well said french with a sigh do you as you please my dear this count for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation
test1950,"and now, my dear france, let us talk of something else."
test1951,then should anything appear to merit a more minimal examination albert m. s. could follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the concierge store and which means a particular description
test1952,shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and headed from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the praying eyes of the curious could penetrate
test1953,at a quarter to ten a valley entered he composed with a little room named john and who only spoke english all albert's establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the count's shaser also
test1954,wait then during the day tell rosie that when i leave the opera i will sup with her as she wishes
test1955,very well at half an hour ten
test1956,is the count up yet?
test1957,the valley left the room.
test1958,"good morning, richard, good morning, good morning, said albert your punctuality really alarms me."
test1959,you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was half past
test1960,"no no, my dear fellow, do not confound our plans."
test1961,"yes, he has not much to complain of boar is the capital of charles the seventh."
test1962,it is for that reason you see me so early
test1963,i returned home at day break and stroed to sleep but my head ached and i got up to have a ride for an hour
test1964,pets i will do nothing of the kind the moment they come from government you would find them exaculate.
test1965, besides that that does not concern the home but the financial department
test1966,about what about the papers?
test1967,in the entire political world of which you are one of the leaders
test1968,they say that it is quite fair and that sowing so much red you ought to reap a little blue
test1969,"come, come, that is not bad, said lucia"
test1970,"with your talents you would make your fortune in three or four years,"
test1971,the gentleman had not have needed to sit down to become interested apparently he had taken up the volume from a table as soon as he came in and standing there after a single glances around the apartment had lost himself in its pages
test1972,that has an unflattering sound for me said the young man
test1973,she is willing to risk that
test1974,just as i am the visitor inquired presenting himself with a rather workday aspect
test1975,he was tall and lean and dressed through out in black his shirt color was low and wide and the triangle of linen a little crumpled exhibited by the opening of his waist coat was adorned by a pin containing a small red stone
test1976,in spite of this decoration the young man looked poor as poor as a young man could look who had such a fine head and such a magnificent eyes
test1977,those of basil ransom were dark deep and glowing his head had a character of elevation which fairly added to his statue it was a head to be seen above the level of the crowd on some judicial bench or political platform or even on a bronze medal
test1978,these things the eyes especially with their smaring fire might have indicated that he was to be a great american statesman or on the other hand they might have simply have proven that he came from carolina or abama
test1979,and yet the reader who likes a complete image who desires to read with the senses as well as with the reason is interested not to forget that he prolonged his consonance and swelled his vocals that he was guilty of elisions and interpretations which were equally unexpected and that his discourse was pervaded by something sultan and vast
test1980,and he took up his hat vaguely a soft black hat with a low crown and an immense straight brim
test1981,well so it is they are all witches and wizards medium and spirit rappers and roaring radicals
test1982,if you are going to dinner with her you had better know it oh murder
test1983,he looked at missus luna with intelligent incredibility
test1984,she was attractive and insignificant especially the latter
test1985,have you been in europe?
test1986,"no, i have not been anywhere"
test1987,she hates it she would like to abolish it
test1988,this last remark he made at aventure for he had naturally not devoted his supposition whatever to missus lina
test1989,are you very ambitious you look as you wear
test1990,and missus luna added that now she was back she didn't know what she should do
test1991,one didn't even know what one had come back for
test1992,besides oliver didn't want her in boston and didn't go through the form of saying so
test1993,that was one comfort with the live she never went through any forms
test1994,she stood there looking consciously and rather seriously and missed mister ransom a smile of exceeding faintness played about her lips it was just perceptive enough to light up the native gravity of her face
test1995,her voice was low and agreeable a cultivated voice and she extended a slender white hand to her visitor her remarked with some solemnity she felt a certain guilt of participation in missus luna's discretion that he was intensely happy to make her acquaintance
test1996,he observed that miss chancellor's hand was at once called and limp she merely placed it in her without exerting the smallest pressure
test1997,i shall be back very late we are going to a theater party that's why we dine so early
test1998,miss miss chance's familiarity extended even to her sister she remarked to miss chance that she looked as if she got up for a sea voyage
test1999,paul ransom announced this fact to himself as if he had made a great discovery but in reality he had never been so beoian as at that moment
test2000,the women they had hitherto known had been mainly of his own soft climb and it was not often they exhibited the tendency he detected and cursively declared in missus luna's sister
test2001,ransom was pleased with the vision of that remedy it must be repeated that he was very provincial
test2002,he was sorry for her but he saw in a flash that no one could help her that was what made her tragic
test2003,she could not defend herself against a rich admiration a kind of tenderness of envy of anyone who had been so happy as to have that opportunity
test2004,his family was ruined they had lost their slaves their property their friends and relations their home had tasted of all the cruelty of defeat
test2005,the state of mississippi seemed to him the state of despair so he surrendered the remnants of his property to his mother and sisters and at nearly thirty years of age alied for the first time in new york in the costume of his province with fifty dollars in his pocket and a knowing hunger in his heart
test2006,it was in the female line as bale's ransom had written in her answer to her letter with a good deal of form and flourish he spoke as if they had been royal houses
test2007,if it had been possible to send missus ransom money or even clothes she would have been like that but she had no means of assuring how such an offer would be taken
test2008,oil had a fear of everything but her greatest fear was of being afraid
test2009,she had erected it into a sort of rule of conduct that when she saw a risk she was to take it and she had frequent humiliation at finding herself safe after all
test2010,she was perfectly safe after writing to bazel ransom and indeed it was difficult to see what he could have done to her except thank her he was only exceptionally superior for her letter and assure her that he would come and see and see her the first time his business he was beginning to get a little should take him to boston
test2011,he was too simple too missouri for that she was almost disappointed
test2012,of all things in the world contention was most sweet to her the why it is hard to imagine if she was always caused her tears headaches a day or to in bed a cute emotion and it was very possible baze ransom would not care to contend
test2013,miss chancier herself has thought so much on the important subject would she not make a few remarks and give them some of her experiences?
test2014,how did the ladies and beachy street feel about the ballot?
test2015,perhaps you could speak for them more than for some others
test2016,with her immense sympathy for reform she found herself so often wishing that reformers were a little different
test2017,ollie had hated to hear that fine avenue talked about as if it was such a remarkable place and to live in that were a proof of royal glory
test2018,all sorts of inferior people lived there and so brilliant a woman as missus fender who lived at bruceberry but not to mix things up.
test2019,she knew her place in the boston hierarchy and it was not what missus farner's supposed that there was a want of perspective in talking to her as if she had been a representative of the aristocracy
test2020,she wished to work in another field she had long been being occupied with the romance of the people
test2021,this might be one of the most accessible of pleasures but in point of fact she had not found it so
test2022,chary was a young man in a white overcoat and a paper collar it was for him in the last analysis that the cared much the most
test2023,oil of chancellor wondered how missus fender would treat their branch of the question
test2024,if it had been necessary we are prepared to take certain steps to conceal the shrinking.
test2025,our movement is for all it would also be the most delicate ladies
test2026, raise the standard among them and bring me your thousand names
test2027,a look after the details as as well as the bookcoursers missus fender added in a tone as explainable as could be expected of such a woman and with a smile of which the sweetness was thrilling to her listener
test2028,oil of chancellor with a face which seemed to plead for a removal of responsibility.
test2029,i want to be near them to help them.
test2030,it was one thing to choose for herself but now the great representative of the enfrancing of their sex from every form of bandage had chosen for her
test2031,the happiness of women
test2032,they were her sisters they were her own and the day of her delivery had dawned
test2033,this was the only sacred cause this was with the great the dust revolution it was triumph it was sweep everything before it it must exact from the other the brutal blood stained ravening race the last particle of expiration
test2034,there would be names of women weak insulted punished but devoted in every parts of their being to the cause and asking no better fate than to die for it
test2035,it was not clear to this interesting girl in what manner such a sacrifice at this last would be required of her that she solved a matter through a kind of sunwise mist of emotion which made danger as rosy's success
test2036,when miss bird's eye approached it transformed her familiar her comedic shape and made the little little humanistic hack seem already a murderer
test2037,ollie chancellor looked at her with love remembered that she had never in her long and rewarded weary life had a thought of an impulse for herself
test2038,she had been consumed by the passion of sympathy it had crumpled her into as many creases as an old glazed disended glove
test2039,"but excuse me, you didn't figure on doing some detecting and giving up fishing."
test2040,and shag with the freedom of an old servant stood looking at his master as if not quite understanding the new twist the affairs had taken.
test2041,"i'm going off fishing, i may not catch anything and may not want to after i get there."
test2042,"get ready, shag yes. yes, colonel."
test2043,and having putting himself in a fair way as he had hoped to solve some of the problems connected with the darsy case colonel ashley went down to police headquarters to learn more facts in the connection with the murder of the east indian
test2044,"pincus and daniel haven't you, carl, yeah?"
test2045,karl was too much engaged in watching the blue smoke curl up from his cigar just then to say more.
test2046,"are you going to work on that case, colonel?"
test2047,"but he hadn't any more to do with it, colonel, that cat."
test2048," perhaps not, admitted colonel ashley."
test2049,we've got our man and that's all we want.
test2050,"you're on that nary case, they tell me in a way, yes."
test2051,"i'm working in the interest of the young men,"
test2052,it's just one of them coincidence's like.
test2053,busted his head in with a heavy candlestick one of a pair.
test2054,"gad, explained the colonel."
test2055,the very pair i was going to buy.
test2056,"look here, colonel do you know anything about this?"
test2057,and the detective's professional instincts got the upper hand of his friendship not the least in the world not as much as you do was the cool answer
test2058,i happen to see those candlesticks in the window of single futts shop the other day and i may have my mind to buy them when i had a chance.
test2059,now i'm afraid i won't but how did it happen?
test2060,"but i don't know whether that's his first or his last name, anyway, he had a partner named share lee."
test2061,"however, he and fitt didn't go along very well, it seems."
test2062,ne neighbors often heard him spaking a lot and this afternoon they went at it again and hot and heavy.
test2063,to dark a man went into a lamp.
test2064,he found the place without a light in it stumbled over something on the floor and there was alie's body with the head bucked in and in this heavy candlestick near it.
test2065,"sure, held so tight we could not get it out."
test2066,maybe the fight was the fight was about who owned the watch for the daggles talked in their foreign language and none of the neighbors could tell what they were saying i see.
test2067,and the watch have you it yes it's here.
test2068,"that's the watch, announced the headquarters detective, reaching in for it going in it see."
test2069,you're not as screaming as all that are you just because it was in a dead man's hands and a woman's.
test2070,and daniel's voice was simply skeptical.
test2071,"yes, it may have some rough edges on it."
test2072,and i've read enough about herbs to know the danger i'd advise you to be careful.
test2073,"if you don't mind, i should like to examine this a bit."
test2074,"before the big wind in irland suggested thong with the nod of its irish companion slightly, they'll have half the colonel."
test2075,"that's right, agreed the colonel as he continued to move his magnifying glass over the surface of the still ticking watch."
test2076,and a close observer might have observed that he did not touch his bare hands to the time piece but poked it about and touched it here and there with the end of a lead pencil
test2077,and danielson take a friend's advice and don't be too free with that watch too free with it.
test2078,"as the surprise detective yes,"
test2079,"don't scratch yourself on it, whatever you do why not?"
test2080," simply because this watch,"
test2081,someone out here to see you.
test2082,"all right, there be there in a second."
test2083,shing foot was the painting answer.
test2084,"i want to talk over darsy's case with you the commander had said and the two had talked, had thought, had talked again and now we were silent for a time."
test2085,"what are the chances of getting him off legally if we go at it from a negative standpoint, asked the colonel."
test2086,"rather a hypothetical question, college but i should say it might be a fifty fifty proposition."
test2087,at best he would get off with the scot's verdict of not proven but he doesn't want that nor do i
test2088,and you i don't want it either.
test2089,but i want to know just where we stand now i know.
test2090,but i need to do a little more smoking out first now i wanted to think.
test2091,if you excuse me i'll pretend i'm fishing and i may catch something.
test2092,"in fact, i have a feeling that i will land my fish."
test2093,"i'd recommend him to you instead of blackstone. thanks, kenneth."
test2094,what is it perhaps i can help you?
test2095,"the old adage of two heads, you know."
test2096,"yes, it still holds good."
test2097,"no alamo, replied the colonel, puzzled yes, just that."
test2098,and there's no reason you should know.
test2099,chuckled the colonel as he skillfully played the luckless trout now struggling to get loose from the hook.
test2100,and when the fish was landed panning on the grass and shag had been roused from his slum to slip the now limp fish into the crele colonel ashley gave a sigh of relief and remark i think i see it now
test2101,"the reason she asked no alamo, inquired kenneth,"
test2102,no i wasn't thinking of that.
test2103,however don't i think i'm not interested in your case i've finished enough for today.
test2104,"well, i don't know that you can."
test2105,"it isn't generally known when the lawyer that the hotel keeper's wife has left him,"
test2106,it was one of what at the first might be called refined cruelty on her husband's part degenerating gradually into that of a baser sort
test2107,"you don't mean that large struck her that there was physical abuse do you, asked the colonel that's what he did."
test2108,the college did not disclose the fact that it was no news to him.
test2109,aren gratton's statement was being unexpectedly confirmed.
test2110,he remembered that cynthia and grafft had once been in love with each other.
test2111,she said he had struck her more than once and she could stand it no longer.
test2112,because large made no defense.
test2113,larch by refusing to appear practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation.
test2114,so i had to let her have her way and we did not ask the court for money though i had no such squeaky feelings when it came to my counsel fee.
test2115,"no, but he will or i'll sue him and get judgment oh he'll pay all right."
test2116,and it takes all sorts of people to make it up.
test2117,still i would like to know.
test2118,the murder of missus darsy had some time ago been shifted off the front page though it would get back there when the young jewelers was tried.
test2119,"it had a double reputation, so to speak."
test2120,grave and even reverent the conventions assembled in its ball room and politicians of the upper if not better class they were frequently seen in its dining room or cafe.
test2121,large himself was a peculiar character.
test2122,in a smaller place he would have been called a salon keeper.
test2123,"and it was this man, rich, it was said handsome certainly that sandra richardson had married"
test2124,to this was the answer whispered money.
test2125,and in a way it was true.
test2126,she also saw an opportunity of paying old debts and reaping some rewards.
test2127,after the marriage which was a brilliant and gay one if not happy the large hotel it could be hard to call a home became the scene of many festive occasions
test2128,then it was said of large that soon after the echoes of the wedding chimes died away he had begun to treat his wife with a refined cruelty that hidden away from the public beneath his habitual manner there was the rawness of the brut
test2129,but it was noticed that the older and more conservative families were less often represented and when they were it was it was by some of the younger members whose reputations were already smitted or who had not have yet obtained any and were willing to take a chance
test2130,"it would not do, you know after that story came out for me and the vice chancellor who sat in the case as well as other judges and members of the bar to be seen there kenny explained to the colonel"
test2131,while meanwhile colonel alexander was a very busy man and to no one did he tell very much about his activities he did darsy frequently at the jail and to that young man's pleadings that something to be done always returned the answer
test2132,don't worry it will come out out right.
test2133,i'm going to rectify them but it will take time.
test2134,"it's hard for miss mason too, although she is bearing up like a major."
test2135,so king god bail who put it up.
test2136,"it was high, large."
test2137,they took harry away a while ago.
test2138,but his is a pretty un certainty to be in just the same.
test2139,only that i darsy hesitated and grew red.
test2140,"good evening, colonel, he called jenel. will you join me in a western rabbit?"
test2141,"thank you, no."
test2142,i'm afraid my digestion is not quite up to that as i've had to cut out my fishing of late.
test2143,now as to certain matters in the store on the morning of the murder
test2144,the stopped clocks for instance have you any theory
test2145,there were three of them the center figure being that of harry king and he was very much intoxicated
test2146,that is not always but sometimes it happened to be so now
test2147,i beg your pardon he said in the cultural tones he knew so well how to use yet of which he made so little use of late
test2148,"i said where have you been, remarked the other we've missed you."
test2149,i said i was golfing he went on exceedingly distinctly though with an effort.
test2150,"why polonia, some one asked."
test2151,because dear friend replied king softly he somewhat resembles a certain person here who talks too much but who is not so wise as he thinks
test2152,there was a rattle of coins on the mahogany bar as king sought to disentangle a single bill from the watted currency in his pocket.
test2153,it's it's an odd coin an old roman one that missus darsy had in her inner private collection kept in the jewelry store safe was the whispered answer
test2154,i went over them the day and noticed some were missing though i saw them all when i paid a visit to her just a short time before she was killed
test2155,that was herne when on the jure.
test2156,"now harry king has it exclaimed, colonel allison,"
test2157,even the sun came out pale and watery at night
test2158,the colds and dramaicism of the rainy months vanished
test2159,was asked worker last sunday you did it when the youngers
test2160,well didn't they shoot us one man exhibited his arm in a slen
test2161, haven't i got something to remember them by by the devil's
test2162,who are you to destroy the legal government who is linson a german
test2163,who are you a counter revolutionist a provocative they beloved it at him
test2164,you call yourself the people of russia but you are not the people of russia
test2165,the peasants are the people of russia wait until the peasants
test2166,we know what the prisoners will say aren't they working man like ourselves
test2167,this man has specifically welcome the call to a congress of citizens
test2168,this last were the young young people who had been serving in the army
test2169,whereupon the old executive committee left the hall
test2170,down with him they shook
test2171,fearful tamales cries down with the palloves key
test2172,on my return i visited smally no such accusation was made against me there after a brief conversation i left and that's all let anyone present make such an accusation
test2173, meanwhile the question of the status of the executive committee was agitating all minds
test2174,by declaring the assembly extraordinary conference it had been planned to block the election of the executive committee
test2175,but this worked both ways the social revolutionist decided that if the congress had no power over the executive committee then the executive committee had no power over the congress
test2176,on the twenty seventh occurred the debate on the land question which revealed the differences between the agricultural program of the bolshivik and the left socialist revolutionaries
test2177,the constituent assembly will not dare to break with the wheel of the people
test2178,followed him leanin listen to now with absorbing intensity
test2179,the first stage was the crushing of autonomy and the crushing of the power of the industrial capitalist and the land owners who's interests are closely related
test2180,the tumors and jemstones were dropped
test2181,he knew that an agreement with the polesvikiy was being discussed but he did not know that it had been concluded
test2182,he spoke to the ram convention
test2183,the villages will save us in the end
test2184,but the present movement is international and that is why it is invincible
test2185,the will of millions of workers is now concentrated in the hall
test2186,a new humanity will be born of this war
test2187,i greet you with the christianity of a new russian life and freedom
test2188,then i took up a great stone from among the trees and coming up to him smoted him there with all my might and crushed in his skull as he lay dead drunk
test2189,behold a ship was making for the island through the dashing sea and clashing waves
test2190, hearing this i was so troubled remembering what i had before suffered from the ape kind
test2191,upon this he brought me a cotton bag and given it to him and said take this bag and fill it with pebbles from the beach and go forth with the company of the townspeople to whom i will give a charge respecting you
test2192,do as they do and be like you shall gain what may further your return voyage to your native land
test2193,then he carried me to the beach where i filled my bag with pebbles large and small and currently we saw a company of folk issue from the town each bearing a bag like mine filled with pebbles
test2194,to these he committed me commending me to their care and saying this man is a stranger so take him with you and teach him how to together that he may get his daily bread and you will earn your reward and reward in heaven
test2195,now sleeping under these trees were many apes which when they saw us rose and fled from us and swam up among the branches where our companions began to pelt them with what they had in their bags and the apes fell to plucking the fruit of the trees and casting them at the folk
test2196,we weighed anchor and sharad perceived to the dawn of the day and ceased to say in her permitted say
test2197,when it was the five hundred and forty ninth night
test2198,and ceased not sailing until we arrived safely at wassar
test2199,there i abode a little and then went on to bagdad where i entered my quarter and found my house and for gathered with my family and satisfied my friends who gave me joy of safe return and i laid up all my goods and valuable in my storehouses
test2200,after which i will return to my old merry way of life and forgot all i had suffered in the great profit and gain i had made
test2201,next morning as soon as it was light he prayed the dawn prayer and after blessing mahumad the cream of all creatures he took himself to the house of sin bad the seaman and wished him a good day
test2202,here i found a great ship ready for sea and full of merchants and notable people who had with them goods of price so i embarked my bales there in
test2203,happyly among you is one righteous whose prayers the lord will accept
test2204,presently the ship struck the mountain and broke up and all and everything on board of her were plunged into the sea
test2205,but it burns in their bellies so they cast it up again and they congeleled on the surface of the water where its color and quantities are changed and at last the waves cast it as shore and the travelers and merchants who know it collected and sell it
test2206,each that died we washed and sheltered in some of the clothes and linen cast a shore by the tides and after little the rest of my friends died one by one till i had buried the last of the party and a boat alone on the island but with a little provision left i who was want to have so much
test2207,but there is majesty and there is no might in save in ala the glorious the great
test2208,when it was the five hundred and sixty first night
test2209,then signing for myself i set to work collecting a number of pieces of chinese and corman and alson's wood and i bound them together with ropes from the wreckage then i chose out from the broken up up straight planks of even size and fixed them firmly upon the alson wood making me a boat raft a little more than the channel of the stream and i tied it tightly and firmly as if it was nailed
test2210,land after land shall thou see and find but no other life on thy wish shall wait fear not thy soul and thy thoughts are night all woe shall end or soon or late
test2211,i rode my conveyance into the place which was intensely dark and the current carried the raft with it down the underground channel
test2212,and i threw myself down on my face on the raft by reason of the narrowness of the channel while the stream ceased not to carry me along knowing not night from day for the excess of the gloom which encompassed me about and my terror and concern for myself as least i should perish
test2213,when i awake at last i found myself in the light of heaven and opening my eyes i saw myself in a broad stream and the raft mowed to an island in the midst of a number of indians and ababianians
test2214,but i was delighted at my escape from the river
test2215,when they saw i understood them not and made them no answer one of them came forward and said to me in arabic peace be with you oh my brother
test2216,oh my brother answered him we are husbandmen and tillers of the soil who came out to water our fields and plantations and finding you asleep on this raft held hold of it and made it fast by us against thou shouldst awake at your leisure
test2217,i answered for ala's sake am my lord eir i speak give me somewhat to eat for i am starving and after ask me what you will
test2218,when it was the five hundred and sixty second night
test2219,she said it has reached me the ostensible king that sinbad the seaman continued when i landed and found myself among the indians and ababians and had taken some rest they consulted among themselves and said to one another there is no help for it but we carry him with us and present him to our king that he may acquire him with his adventures
test2220,so i consorted with the chief of the islanders and they paid me the most respect
test2221,so i rose without stay or delay and kissed the king's hand and accompanied him with my longing to set out with the merchants for that i pined after my people and my own land
test2222,thou art thy own master yet if it be thy will to abide with us on our head and eyes be it for thy gladness is with thy company
test2223,by ala ala are my lord answered i thou hath indeed overwhelmed me with thy favors and well doings but i weries for a sight of my friends and family and native country
test2224,then i took leave of him and of all my intimate's and acquaintances in the island and embarked with the merchant safah said
test2225,he asked me when they came and i said to him by ala a commander of the faithful i know not the name of the city nor the way thither
test2226,for state precesions a throne is set for him upon a huge elephant twelve cubers high and upon this he sits having his great lords and officers and guests standing in two ranks on his right hand and on his left
test2227,the letter has shown me this and as for the power of his domain has told us what now has died witness
test2228,presently my friends came to me and i distributed presence among my family and gave arms and large s as after which i yielded myself to joints and enjoyment mert and mery making and forgot all that i had suffered
test2229, such as such oh my brothers is the history of what befelt me in my sixth voyage and tomorrow in insalah
test2230,i will tell you the story of my seventh and last voyage which is still more wonderful and marvelous than that of the first six
test2231,when it was the five hundred and sixty third night
test2232,she said it had reached me oh impressive king that when sinnad the seamens had related the history of what befalled him in his sixth voyage and all the company had dispersed sinnad the landmen went home and slept as of want
test2233,the seventh voyage of sinbad the seaman
test2234,no o company that after my return from my sixth voyage which brought me abundant profit i resumed my former life in all possible joints and enjoyment and mert and making merry day and night and i tared some time in this solitude and satisfaction until my soul began once more to long to sail the seas and see foreign countries and company with merchants and here new things
test2235,so having made up my mind i packed up in bales a quantity of precious stuffs suitable for sea trade and repaired with them from badges city to saara town where i found a ship ready for sea and in her a company of considerable merchants
test2236,but the captain arose and tightening in his girtup tucked up his sleeves and after taking refuge with ala from satan the stone climbed to the master head when he looked out right and left and gazing at the passengers and crew failed to buffet in his face and plucking out his beard
test2237,this he said in a source wetted with a little water and after waiting a short time smelt and tasted it and then he took out of the chest a book where he read a while and said weeping know o you passengers that in this book is a marvelous matter indicating that who so come thither shall surely die without hope of escape for that which the ocean is called the sea of the climb of the king where it is a marvelous matter
test2238,a second fish read its appearance and which we had seen not more monstrous
test2239,when suddenly a violent squal of wind rose and smoted the ship which rose out of the water and settled upon a great reef the hound of sea monsters where it broke up and fell a under the planks and all and everything on board were plunked into the sea
test2240,unfortunately there could be no doubt or misconception as the platerbab's guilt
test2241,he had not only plated guilty but had expressed his intention of repeating his escape in other directions as soon as circumstances permitted throughout the trial he was busy examining a small model of the free trade hall in manchester
test2242,the judge could not possibly find that the prisoner had not deliberately and intentionally blown up the albert hall the question was could they find any insuance in circumstances which would permit of an equitation
test2243,of course any sentence which the law might feel compelled to inflict would be followed by an immediate pardon but it was highly desirable from the government's point of view that the necessity for such an exercise of clameon should not arise
test2244,i had long pardon on the eve of a by election with threats of a heavy voting defection if it was withheld or even delayed would not necessarily be a surrender but it would look like one
test2245,therefore the anxiety in the crowded court and in the little groups gathered round the tape machines in white hall and donning street and other affected centers
test2246,the judge returned from considering their verdict there was a flutter an excited murmur a death like hush
test2247,the farman delivered his message
test2248,the jury find a prisoner guilty of blowing up the albert hall
test2249,the jury wished to add a writer drawing attention to the fact that a by election is spending in the parliamentary division of neighbors on hand
test2250,and may the lord have mercy on the poll a junior council exclaimed irreverently
test2251, fifteen hundred said a prime minister with a shudder it's too horrible to think of
test2252,our majority last time was only a thousand and seven
test2253,seven thirty amended the prime minister we must avoid any appearance of precipitation
test2254,not later than seven thirty then said the chief organizer i have promised the agent down there that he should be able to display posters announcing platerbaff is out before the poll opens
test2255,he said it was our only chance of getting a telegraph redaps in tonight
test2256,despite the earlyness of the hour a small crowd had gathered in the street outside and the horrible menacing three lone refran of the fifteen hundred voting men came in a steady steady chant
test2257,"he exclaimed, won't go"
test2258,he says he never has left prison without a breast band to play him out and he is not going to go without one now
test2259,said the prime minister we can hardly be supposed to supply a release prisoner with a brass band how on earth would we defend it on the estimates
test2260,anyway he won't go unless he has a pants
test2261,paul opens in five minutes
test2262,the spiller out yet
test2263,in heaven's name why
test2264,the chief administrator ran off
test2265,this is not a moment for standing dignity he observed bluntly musicians must be supplied at once
test2266,can you get a strike permit as the organization
test2267,i'll try said the home secretary and went to the phone
test2268,eight o'clock struck the crowd outside chanted with an increasing volume of sound will vote the other way
test2269,a telegraph is brought in
test2270,it was from the central committee rooms at nemesis
test2271,without a band he would not go and they had no band
test2272,a quarter past ten half past
test2273,have you any band instruments of an easy nature to play
test2274,demanded the chief organization of the prison governor drums symbols those sort of things
test2275,the words have a private band of their own said the governor but of course i couldn't allow the men themselves
test2276,lend me the instruments said a chief organizer
test2277,the popular song of the moment replied the agitator after a moment's reflection
test2278,it was a song they had all heard hundreds of times so there was no difficulty in turning out a passable imitation of it to the improvised trains of i don't want to do it the prisoners threw forth to freedom
test2279,the word of the song had reference it was understood to the incarcerated government and not to the destruction of the albert hall
test2280,the seat was lost after all by a narrow maturity
test2281,the local trade unionists took off offense at the fact of cabinet ministers having personally acted as strike breakers and even the release of plater buff failed to pacify them
test2282,with that notable failing of his he was not the sort of person one wanted in one house
test2283,well the failing still exists doesn't it said the husband or do you suppose a reform of characters is included along with the state
test2284,besides sinistuous part his being rich will make a difference in the way people will look at his failing
test2285,when a man is absolutely wealthy not merely well to do all suspicion of sorted motivation natural disappears the thing becomes merely a tiring melody
test2286,william pigeon coat had suddenly become air to his uncle sir william pigeon coat on the death of his cousin major william pigeon coat who had suffered to the after effects of apollo accident
test2287,a willford pigeon coat had covered himself with honor in the course of muller's campaigns and the name luke lily had been a terrible weakness in the family ever since the new air to the family dignity and estates was a young man of about five and twenty who was known to be more by repetition than by person to a wide circle of cousins and kinsmen
test2288,and the reputation was an unpleasant one
test2289,from his late school days onward he had been possessed by an acute and obstinate form of cliptomania he had the acquiring instinct of the collector without any of the collector's discrimination
test2290,the search usually produced a large and varied yield this is funny said peter pigeon to his wife some half an hour after his conversation here is a telegram from wilford saying he is passing through here in his motor and would like to stop and pay as his respects
test2291,signed wilfred pigeon coat
test2292,i suppose he is bringing us as a gift for the silver wedding good gracious
test2293,the talk flitted nervously and hastily from one personal topic to another
test2294,in the drawing room after dinner their nervousness and awkwardness increased
test2295,oh we haven't shown you the silver wedding presents said missus peter suddenly as those struck by a brilliant idea for entertaining the guest here they all are
test2296, such nice useful gifts a few duplicates of course
test2297,seven cream jugs put in peter
test2298,we feel that we must live on cream for the rest of our lives
test2299,of course some of them can be changed
test2300,i put it down by the claret jug said wilford busy with another object
test2301,vigilance was not completely crowned with a sense of victory
test2302,after they had had good night to their visitor missus peter expressed her conviction that he had taken something
test2303,how on earth are we to know said peter the mean pig hasn't brought us a present and i'm hanging if he shall carry one off
test2304,it is the only thing to do
test2305,william was late in coming down to breakfast and his manner showed plainly that something was a miss
test2306,it's an unpleasant thing to have to say he blurted out presently but i'm afraid you must have a thief among your servants something's been taken out of my portman to
test2307,it was a little present from my mother and myself for your silver wedding
test2308,i should have given it to you last night after dinner only it happened to be a crain jug and you seemed annoyed at having so many duplicates so i felt rather awkward about giving you another
test2309,the snaker had been an orphan this many years
test2310,lady ernestine pigeon count his mother moved in circles which were entirely beyond their compas or ambitions and the son would probably one day be an ambassador
test2311, husband and wife looked blankly and desperately at one another
test2312,it was missus peter who arrived first at an inspiration how dreadful to think there are thieves in the house we keep a drawing room locked up at up at night of course but anything might be carried off while we are at breakfast
test2313,she rose and went out hurriedly as though to assure herself that the drawing room was not being stripped of its silverwear and returned a moment later bearing a cream jug in her hands
test2314,the pitching and coats had turned pale than ever missus peter had a final inspiration
test2315,peter dashed out of the room with glad relief he had lived so long during the last few minutes that a golden wedding seemed with measureable distance
test2316,missus peter turned to her guest with confident coinage
test2317,peter's little weakness it transends in the family good lord
test2318,do you mean to say he is an acleptomaniac like cousin snaker?
test2319,brave little woman said bear it with a gasp of relief i could have never done it
test2320,i'm from the cutter lying off the coast
test2321,don't cry he said i was obliged to come
test2322,and and you have not found out anything came in quick frightful tones
test2323,i wish you believe me that i am in great trouble about it you are
test2324,"that my father, sir rise and graham have smuggled goods here"
test2325,he could not help it he hates the smugglers you shall not tell
test2326,pray pray you say you will not arar is silent
test2327,then as arches stood in the dark literally as gassed with astonishment he heard the faint rustling once more and again all was silent
test2328,he laughed but it was a kind of laugh full of vexation injured love of love of our own love of our own integrity of which arkard ray stroke in the full flush of his young youth in his importance as a british officer had a pretty good stock
test2329,and all comes of dressing up in this stupid way like a rough fisher lad
test2330,cold water came on this idea directly as he recalled the fact that the darkness was intense and celia could not have seen him
test2331,i'll soon show them that i am not going to be played with
test2332,for it suddenly occurred to him that he was not only a prisoner but a prisoner and the power of a very reckless set of people who would stop it at nothing
test2333,no he thought to himself i don't believe he would kill me but they would knock me about
test2334,the kick he had received was a foretaste of what he might expect and after a little consideration he came to the conclusion that his duty was to escape and get back to the cutter as quickly as he could
test2335,to do this he must scheme lie hid until a morning then make for the nearest point and signal for help unless a boat's crew were already searching for him how to escape
test2336,the window was barred but he went to it and tried the bars one by one to find them all solidly fitted into the stone silt
test2337,next next time as he felt his way around his hand touched an old metal marble piece fireplace chimney
test2338,yes if other ways failed he could escape up the chimney
test2339,no that was too bad he could not do that
test2340,symmetry and pity for the dwellers and the hose were completely gone now and he said his teeth fast and mentally called himself a weak idiot for ever thinking about such people
test2341,a narrow table against the wall in two places
test2342,he went and tried to force his head through recalling where a person's head would go the rest of the body would pass
test2343,but there was no chance for his body there the head would not go first
test2344,a fellow who was shut up in prison for life might do it he said but not in a case like this
test2345,sure you've looked around everywhere boy yes father quate
test2346,i'm going home to breakfast
test2347,shall i come to father no
test2348,stop here until sir sir comes down and tell him i'm very sorry that we should have cleared out the last night only a born fool saw jerry andandy's boat coming into the cave and came running to say it was a party from the cutter yes father
test2349,tell him to not be easy it's all right and i'll have everything clear away to tonight
test2350,the dull sound of departing steps and a low whistling sound coming down through the skylight window into the cabin where archy ray lay with his heavy eyes pressed down by sleep
test2351,what a queer dream he thought to himself
test2352,but queer for mister mister to be talking like that to andrew teel the boy who helped the cook
test2353,and why did andy call mister father
test2354,there was an interval of thinking over this nottiest question during which the low sound went on
test2355,and i'm hungry too time i was up i suppose
test2356,no he was not dreaming for he was looking out on the sea over which a faint mist hung with reeds of smoke
test2357,what did they say false alarm tell servants and they would clear all away to night see if anything had been left about lobo boat
test2358,once out of that room he could run and by daylight the smugglers dare not hunt him down
test2359,oh those bars he mentally exclaimed and he was advancing towards them when he drew near there was a rustling noise under the window a couple of hands seized the bars there was a scratching of toes in against work and ram's face appeared to gaze into the room by intention but into the astonished countenances of the young midman's it was a scratching of toes against work and ram's face appeared to gaze into the room by intention but into the astonished countenances of the young midman instead
test2360,ram was the first to recover from his surprise
test2361,"hello, he said who were you?"
test2362,go round and open the door i was shut in night by mistake
test2363,i saw you last night and wondered who his was
test2364,it was you father kicked for shirking and my well i hardly knew you

test2367,"i think i don't know you, mister orris."
test2368,will not do to me quickly i know you
test2369,have been playing the spy that's what you've been doing who you've been doing who locked you in
test2370,arth step back to the door listening but there was not a sound
test2371,he has gone to give the alarm thought the prisoner and he looked excitedly around for a way of escape
test2372,nothing but the chimney presented itself
test2373,a happy inspiration had come and placing one hand on his chest he thrust in the other gave a tug and drew out his little curved dirt glared at the edge ransled to the window and began to cut at one of the bars labor in vain
test2374,he divided the paint and produced a few squeaks and grating sounds as he realized the attempt was madness
test2375,the result was not very satisfying but sufficient so to make him essay the bar of the window once more producing a grading era selling sound as he found that now he did make a little impression so little though that the probability was if he kept working well for twenty four hours he would not get through
test2376,but at the end of five minutes he stopped and threw back the dirt into its sheath
test2377,no i can't part with that hahahah left the boy's voice late
test2378,but i'll yes i'll give you a ginnie if you will let me out
test2379,ginns of the boy think i'll do it for her ginnies well then and
test2380,be quick it's a good fellow i have to get to away at once
test2381,not you only a sham
test2382,why your clothes don't fit you and your caps put on sorru
test2383,never mind about that let me out of this place
test2384,i told you a fisher boy cried archy impatiently but trying not to offend his visitor who possessed the power of conferring freedom by speaking sharply
test2385,not you look like a wild beast in a cage with a monkey you insolent
test2386,archey checked him and the boy laughed
test2387,it was your turn yesterday it's my day today what a game
test2388,you laughed and flared at me when i was on the cutters deck
test2389,i say you do look like a ramming just like a big monkey in a show
test2390,ram showed his white teeth as he burst out with a long low fit of laughter
test2391,you rope me and he said
test2392,why i could tie you up in a knot and you heave you off the cliff any day what a game
test2393,a bit of a midi fed with salt tack and welewey biscuit talk of giving me ropes end
test2394,one more time will you come and let me out no
test2395,to his astonishment the board did not flinch but thrusted his own arms through placing them about the mida's waist clinking his hand behind and uttering a sharp whistle
test2396,"seemed good enough spires last night, mr. gur, yes, mr. gur."
test2397,yes sir but he could turn on the cliff at any moment
test2398,"yes, been quite ready yes sir"

test2411,"as awkward, mister gur, awkward."
test2412,"yes, sir, of course."
test2413,say awkward in the future not awkward.
test2414,"i mean all alone by myself, sir."
test2415,but four are not a public house for ten miles didn't mean that
test2416,then what did you mean speak out and do not do the double shuffle all over my clean deck no sir
test2417,hopping about like a cat on hot bricks.
test2418,now then why do you want to go shore?
test2419,"big pardon didn't mean no, sir, the soldier touching his foreloke."
test2420,"yes, sir, said the man, holly, shall i go at one sir?"
test2421,"no wait,"
test2422,keep a sharp look on the cliff to the cliff and if you see if it is a rainstorm that is sending signals for a boat.
test2423,he swam round walked off and began swimming the shore again with his master on the deck exchange looks which meant a great deal
test2424,"that last, the little lieutenant could bear the anxiety no longer"
test2425,"pip away them into that boat, he said and the crew sprang in"
test2426,now mister gug i said i'm only going to say one thing to you in the way of instructions yes sir
test2427,"begging pardon, said the master deprecatingly"
test2428,"steady my lads steady, cried the master keep stroke and then he began to make plans as to his first procedures on as his first procedures on being getting shore and then he began to make plans as to his first procedures on as his first procedures on being getting shore"

test2434,say mister gurser which thanks i am for you for speaking so but you don't really think he has come to harm
test2435,"i hope not, dick i hope not, but smugles don't stand at anything sometimes"

test2443,"here, my lad, where's your master?"
test2444,"yes, i say, where's your master?"
test2445,gur turned away patiently again and signing to his men to follow they all began to tramp up the track leading towards the hoos with the rabbits scuttling away among the furs and showing their white cottony tails for a moment as they dared down into their holes
test2446,i don't know i'm up a dick and a man can't be sure
test2447,gurled and stood at his business while the baron who had turned sally and more careous as his drew a breath of full relief one of your ship boys he said

test2469,but she failed to find the comfort she sought for annoyances continued in a more aggressive form
test2470,two months after this incident the same perpetrators again entered our home in the day of the night and at the point of a pistol tried to force my mother to set fire to her own home
test2471,i have always felt that the exposure to which she was subject on this cruel journey too hard even for a man to take was the direct cause of her death
test2472,harson's bill was to go to waverling where she was hounded continuously
test2473,one of the conditions upon which her life was alive was that she would report leckson weekly

test2488,the wounds of both forces were gathered up and were placed in houses
test2489,although every book reporting to narrate the lives of the younger brothers is told of the liberty robbery and implied that we had a part in it the younger people were not suspected at that time nor for a long time afterwards
test2490,it was claimed by people of freedom that they positively recognized among the robbers all shepherds red makers and bud pines who had seen service with quenel
test2491,this raid was accompanied by bloodhead judge mclane the banker being shot though though fatally

test2515,i stayed there until the eighth of february eighteen seventy four
test2516,i had not heard of that when i wrote the letter of eighteen seventy four and to correct any misappreciation that might be created by omitting it i will say that at the time i was at nioshell kansas with a droe of cattle which i sold to major ray
test2517,it was immediately following the rock island robbery at eight air iya that their first appeared a delivery of some local papers in missouri to connect us with this robbery
test2518,i urged on the boys that whatever happened we should not shoot any one
test2519,miller as i saw the bridge the three were on some dry boxes at the corner near the bank and as soon as they saw us went right into the bank instead of waiting for us to get there
test2520,when we came up i came up from the door which they had left open in their hurry
test2521,j s alison whose hardware store was near tried to go into the bank but miller ordered him away and he ran around the corner shouting
test2522,get your guns boys they're robbing the bank
test2523,and i call him to get inside at the same time firing a pistol shot in the air as a signal to the three boys at the bridge that we had been discovered
test2524,almost at this instant i heard a pistol shot in the bank
test2525,chadwell woods and jim ran up and joined us shouting to the people in the street to get inside and firing their pistols to emphasize their commands
test2526,if any of our party shot him it must have been woods
test2527,meanwhile the street was getting uncomfortably hot
test2528,every time i saw anyone with a bead on me i would drop off my horse and try to drive the shooter inside but i could not see in every direction
test2529,dr. weller who had gone up to the hotel shot miller and he lay dying in the street
test2530,changing his pistol to his left hand bob ran out and mounted miller's mayor
test2531,what kept you so long ass pits
test2532,to as the rest of the affair inside the bank i take the account of a northwest narrator
test2533,where's the money outside the safe bob asked
test2534,the shutters were closed and this caused an bunker an instance delay that was almost fatal fitch chased him with a bullet
test2535,the first one missed him but the second went through his right shoulder
test2536,that night it started to rain and we wore our horses
test2537, friday we moved towards waterville and friday night we camp between elisian and german lake
test2538,bob shattered elbow is requiring frequent attention and that night we made only nine miles and monday monday night in tuesday the night we spent in a desert farm house close to mancao
test2539,that day a man named dunning discovered us and we took him prisoner
test2540,finally we administered to him an oath to not to betray our wearers until we had time to make our escape and he agreed not to
test2541,no more however was he released than he made post into mancio to announce our presence and in a few minutes another possy was looking for us
test2542,the whistle on the oil bell was and we feared that it was a signal that had been agreed upon to alarm the town in case we were observed but we were not malicious
test2543,he had to sleep with it pilled it on his breast jim being also a cripper with a wound in his shoulder and we could not get much sleep
test2544,but they soon after got close enough so that one of them broke my walking stick with a shot
test2545,we were in sight of our long long horses when they cut us off from the animals and our last hope was gone
test2546,six step to the front shilson colonel t l vault b m rice g g bradford c a proyro and s jseverson
test2547,forming in line four paces apart he ordered them to advance rapidly and concentrate the fire of the whole line the instant the robbers were discovered
test2548,make for the horses i said every man for himself
test2549,there's no use stopping to pick up a friend here but we can't get him through the line just charge them and make them if we can
test2550,i got up as a signal for the charge and we fired one volly
test2551,one of the fellows in the outer line not brave enough himself to join the volunteers who had come in to beat them out was not disposed to believe in the surrender and had his gun leveled on bob in spite of the hankering which was waving as a flag of truth
test2552,sheriff glisson of watah county who was taking bob's pistol from him was also shouting to the fellow
test2553,including those received in and on the way to north field i had eleven wounds
test2554,and sheriff glisson's order not to shoot was the beginning of the protectors that minnesota people established over us
test2555,captain mordoc
test2556,but marshport had flourished enough to kill it off.
test2557,some of mar's laws dated from the time when law's had been hampered by lack of men rather than by the type of men
test2558,the stone wall wall numbers perhaps five hundred
test2559,even delarson's failures had to eat there were stories and shops throughout the district which eeked out some kind of a marginal living
test2560,they were safe from protection raquetes there none bothered to come so far out
test2561,the shopkeepers and some of the less unfortunate people there had protested loud enough to reach clear back to earth
test2562,captain mordoc was an unknown factor and now was asking for more men
test2563,the pressure was enough to get them for him
test2564,gordon reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out mixed with a vague relief
test2565,i've got a free hand and we're going to run this way we would on earth
test2566,your job is to protect the citizens here and that means everyone not breaking the laws whether you feel like it or not no graft
test2567,the first man making a shakedown will get the same treatment we're going to use on the stone wall boys you'll get double pay now and you can live on it
test2568,he picked out five of the men including gordon you five will come with me
test2569,the rest of the rest you can team up any way you want tonight pick any route that's open okay men let's go
test2570,bruce gordon grins slowly as he swang the stick and mordur's eyes fell on him earth cop
test2571,two years gordon admitted
test2572,for a second gordon cursed himself
test2573,he began wondering about security then
test2574, nobody had tried to get in touch with him
test2575,there was a crude lighting system here put up by the citizens at the front of each building a dim fosse bulb glowed when darkness fell they would have nothing else to see by
test2576,moving in two groups of three at opposite sides of the street they began their beat
test2577,there was no chance to save the citizen who was dying from lack of air
test2578,gordon felt the solid pleasure of the finally turned club in his hands
test2579,gordon's eyes popped at that
test2580,he swallowed the sentiment his own club was moving now
test2581,the other four cops had come in reluctantly
test2582,he brought him to the ground with a single blow across the kidneys
test2583,they rounded up the men of the gang and one of the cops started off
test2584,to find a phone and call the wagon
test2585,we're not using wags and mordred told him line up
test2586,if they tried to run they were hit from behind if they stood still they were clumped carefully
test2587,murder indicated one that stood with his shoulder shaking and tears running down his cheeks
test2588,the captain's face was as sick as gordon's felt
test2589,i want the name of every man and the gang you can remember he told the man
test2590,colonel they'd kill me i don't know
test2591,mudrick took his nod as evidence enough and turned to the wretched tuffs
test2592,if he should turn up dead i'll know you boys are responsible and i'll find you
test2593,"to begin brewing shortly after,"
test2594,merdet sent one of the men to pick up a second squad of six and then a third
test2595,and the third one bruce gordon spotted one of the men who had been beaten before
test2596,get a stretcher and take him wherever he belongs he ordered
test2597,but the captain stared finally sighing
test2598,no the cops are giving me we're covered gordon
test2599,but the stone wall gang is backing wane
test2600,but it's going to be tough on them
test2601,bruce gardner mister i've got a yellow ticket from security
test2602,mardok blinked he dropped his eye slowly
test2603,what makes you think wain will be reemitted?
test2604, nobody wants him except a gang of crooks and those in power
test2605,ever see a marian election
test2606,no you're a firsters he can't lose
test2607,and then hell is going to pop and this whole planet may be blown white open
test2608,it fited with the dire predictions of security and what the spying gardon was going to do according to them
test2609,he was getting even fattier now that he was eating better food from the fair restaurant around the corner
test2610,cost a more but they'd be respectable
test2611,because izy is always honest according to how he sees it
test2612,but you got earth ideas of the stuff like i had once
test2613,the groups grew more experienced and mordur was training a new squad every night
test2614,it wasn't exactly legal but nothing was here
test2615,this could lead to abuses as he had seen on earth
test2616,but there probably wouldn't be time for it if mayor wain was re elected.
test2617,it was night outside and the phosphor bulbs of the corners glowed dimly giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the extemporized precinct house
test2618,it had probably been years since any had dared risk it after the sun went down
test2619,and the slow doubtful respect on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that haley's system was working
test2620,gord hit the signal switch and the marsh singer let out a shrill whistle
test2621,gun suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere
test2622,"you can't do it to me,"
test2623,i'm reformed i'm going straight.
test2624,you dammed cops can't noone is blubbering
test2625,one look was enough the work papers had the teltail over thickening of the signature that they had shown up on other papers obviously forries
test2626,some turned away as gordon and the other cop went to work but most of them weren't squeakish
test2627,when it was over the two picked up their wimper and captive
test2628,jenkin's the other cop had been holding the wallet
test2629,must have been making a big contact in something fifty fifty
test2630,there had been over two thousand credits in the wallet
test2631,when gordon and jennings came back mordoc tossed the money to them split it
test2632,whatever comes to hand govna
test2633,"like the social call, gordon asked him"
test2634,the little man shook his head his ancient eighteen year old face turning sober no
test2635,you earn me some bills governor
test2636, eleven hundred and fifty credits
test2637,you didn't pay up your pledge to the captain fund so i had to fill in
test2638,a thousand interest at ten percent a week standard right
test2639,gordon had heard of the friendly interests charged on the side here but he shook his head wrong as he
test2640,hah is he turned it over and shook his head
test2641,now show me where i signed any agreement and i'll pay you back.
test2642,for a second izy's face went blank then he chuckled
test2643,he pulled out the bills and handed them over
test2644,thanks izys thank you yourself
test2645,the kid pocketed the money cheerfully nodding
test2646,the little guy knew mars as many others did apparently from all sides
test2647,and if any of the others had private rings of their own iis was undoubtedly the man to find it out and use the information with a beat such as that even going halfs and with all the graph to the upper brackets he'd still be able to make his pile in a matter of months
test2648,the captain looked completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped into the bench
test2649,go on accept damm.
test2650,there was a man coming from earth on a second ship who would see him
test2651,the little publisher was back at the crusader again
test2652,only gordon and shela were left
test2653,credit had been established again and the businesses were open
test2654,gordon came to a row of temporary bubbles individual dwellings built like the dome but opaque for privacy
test2655,they had been lucky
test2656,shulberg's volunteers were official now
test2657,fat's place was still open though the crooked tables had been removed gordon dropped to a stool slipping off his helmet
test2658,he reached automatically for the glass of ether needleed beer
test2659,thought you'd be in the chips
test2660,that's mars gordon echoed the other's comment why don't you pull off the planet fats you could go back to earth i'd guess the other nodded
test2661,a man says a man gets used to anything hell maybe i can hire some bums to sit around and whop it up when the ships come in and build this as a real old marian den of sin
test2662,there was a grin on the other's face
test2663,finally got our orders for you it's mercury
test2664,we sent twenty others the same way and they failed
test2665,let's say you've shifted some of the misery around a bit and given them a chance to do better
test2666,you can't stay here.
test2667,there's a rocket waiting to trans ship you to the moon on the way to mercury right now gordon side
test2668,and i paid her the pay we earn you from the time you began using your badge she's out shopping

test2670,did you think we'd let you go without seeing you off cabber he asked
test2671,i i oh drad i'm getting old isis you tell him
test2672,he grabbed gordon's hand and willed down the landing plank as he shook his head
test2673,any chester had begun to make the prince with lizzy
test2674,leasely determined to try for honors in english language and literature
test2675,her tastes all lay in this direction her idea being by and by to follow her mother's profession of journalism for which she already showed considerable aptitude
test2676,she had no idea of allowing herself to break down
test2677,what do you mean replied leslie
test2678,"why you will be parting from me, you know"
test2679,i won't be the constant worry and plague of your life
test2680,it is this if by any chance you don't have saint words annie i hope you will allow me to be your room fellow again term next year
test2681,it was annie a flash of light coming into her eyes and then leaving them
test2682,but she said quickly she speak of something which must not take place
test2683,i must path in honor if i don't i shall die
test2684,a few moments later they came a tap at the door
test2685,lisley opened the door
test2686,hariyata stood without
test2687,these letters have just come for you and any chusters she said and as i was coming up stairs i thought i would leave them with you
test2688,leslie thanked her and eagerly grased the little parcel
test2689,her eyes shone with pleasure at the anticipation of the delightful time she would have reveling in the home news the other letter was directed to adyanna cholster
test2690,"here is the letter for you, annie, cried lisey"
test2691,her face grew suddenly white as death what is it
test2692,i have been starving or rather i have been thirsting
test2693,"well read it in peace, say it in peace i won't disturb you"
test2694,i am truly glad it has come
test2695,lesley sat herself with her back to her companion and opened her own letters
test2696,don't notice me replied any
test2697,i must go into the grounds the air is stiffing
test2698,but they are just shutting up
test2699,i shall go i know a way
test2700,just after midnight she rose with a sigh to prepare for bed
test2701,she looked down the room
test2702,now i remember she had a letter which upset her very much and went out
test2703,leslie went to the window and flung it open she put her head out and tried to into the darkness but the moon had already set and she could not see more than a couple of yards in front of her
test2704,she is a very queer eratic creature and that letter there was bad news in that letter there was bad news in that letter
test2705,what can she be doing out by herself?
test2706,lezle left the room but she had been gently gone a dozen places down the corridor before she met any returning
test2707,anna's eyes were very bright her cheeks were no longer pale and there was a brilliant color in them
test2708,she did not take the least notice of leslie but going into the room shut the door
test2709,"don't begin, see you."
test2710,don't start in what do you mean
test2711,i mean that i don't want you to begin to ask questions
test2712,i walked up and down as fast as ever i could outside in order to make myself sleeping
test2713,don't talk to me lizie don't say a single word
test2714,i shall go to sleep that is all i care for
test2715,"dude, siren."
test2716,now drink this at once she said in a voice of authority if you really wish to sleep
test2717,annie waited quietly at the coconut then she uttered a laugh
test2718,"trick that she said,"
test2719,do you want to kill me don't talk any more
test2720,i am sleeping i shall sleep
test2721,she got into bed as she spoke and wrapped the clothes tightly around her
test2722,can you manage with a candle just for once
test2723,"sincerely, city's life"
test2724,she turned off the light and let a candle which she put behind her screen then prepared to get into bed
test2725,enny's manner was very mysterious
test2726,and he did not mean to confine any one that night and the kindest thing was to leave her alone
test2727,tired of tired lizie herself dropped to sleep
test2728,"annie is that you, she called out"
test2729,there was no reply but the sound of hurrying steps came faster and faster now and then they were interrupted by a groan
test2730,oh this will kill me my heart will break this will kill me
test2731,the guild of saint elizabeth
test2732, immediately after dinner that evening lester ran up to her room to make preparations for her visit to east hall
test2733,"i'm not coming, serry"
test2734,every student is to be in the east half of eight
test2735,it doesn't matter replied any whether it is an or or not i'm not coming see nothing about me please
test2736,it burned as with fever
test2737,you don't know what a trial it was for me to have you here
test2738,i want to be alone go
test2739,i know you don't really mean what you say said leslie but of course if you really wish me
test2740,you fear me beyond endurance
test2741,rapping a pretty blue shore around her head and shoulders she turned to annie
test2742,leslie was just closing the door behind her when anny called after her
test2743,i took it out said lisey take it out
test2744,have the goodness to find it and put it back
test2745,but don't lock me out please any
test2746,oh i won't lock you out she said but i must have the key
test2747,jenine's voice was heard in the passage
test2748,as she walked down the corridor she heard it being turned to the lock
test2749,what can this mean she said to herself
test2750,oh i won't press you replied jane
test2751,oh i shall never do that replied lizzy
test2752,you see all the girls except ilean and margary laugh at her and that seems to me to make her worse
test2753,some day jane you must see her
test2754,if you are in london during the summer you must come and pass a pass will you
test2755,that is if you care to confide in me
test2756,i believe poor anny is drily unhappy
test2757,that's just a chain that is that is what frightens me she refuses to come
test2758,refuses to come she cried
test2759,she'll get in her awful scrap
test2760,i am sure she is ill she works too hard and she but there i don't know that i should say anything more
test2761,i'll wait for you here said lizzy
test2762,do come any one do
test2763,scerely likely replied lizzy she told me she was determined not to come to the meeting
test2764,but maria and eline had already departed and lisa and jane found themselves among the students of the great east hall
test2765,miss lorddale was standing with the other teachers and principles of the different halls on a raised platform
test2766,then a round call was gone through by one of the teachers the only absence was any cholster
test2767,the physical part of your training and also the mental part are abundantly supplied in this great house of learning she continued but the spiritual part it seems to me should now to be strengthened
test2768,hare hair and once again hair
test2769,she uttered a strame mark standing up
test2770,margarie and eline were close to her
test2771,i will talk with you bell arches presently she said
test2772,the names of the proposed members are to be submitted to me before this day week
test2773,am i my brother's keeper?
test2774,you ask she continued
test2775,god answers to each of you you are
test2776,the world says no i am not but god says yes you are
test2777,all men are your brothers
test2778,for all who sin all who suffer you are to a certain extent responsible
test2779,after the address the girls themselves were encouraged to speak and a very animated discussion followed
test2780,it was ten o'clock when she had left the hall
test2781,just as she was doing so miss came up
test2782,any cold chester's room fellow is she is not she said
test2783,i see by your face missle roy that you are disdistressed about something are you keeping anything back
test2784,i am afraid i am replied lizzy distress now in her tone
test2785,i must see her myself early in the morning and i'm quite sure that nothing will satisfy miss lorddale except a very ample apology and a full explanation of the reason why she was absent from herself
test2786,exceptions make no difference
test2787,the girl who breaks the rules has to be punished
test2788,i will tell her
test2789,the commons also voted that the new created partners ought to have no voice in this trial because the accusation being agreed to while they were commoners their consent was implied with that of all the commons of england
test2790,in the government of ireland his administration had been equally promoted of his master's interest and that of the subjects committed to his care
test2791,the case of lord montnors of all those who were collected with so much industry the is the most flaming and the least excuseable
test2792,the court which consisted of the cheap officials of the army found the crime to be capital and condemned that nobleman to lose his head
test2793,with a token by which i will discover it
test2794,it is now a full two hundred and forty years since thieves were defined and so long has it been since any man was touched to this extent upon this crime before myself
test2795,let us not to our own destruction awake that sleeping lions by rattling up a company of old records which had for so many years by the wall forgotten and neglected
test2796,however these gentlemen at the bar say they speak for the commonwealth and they believe so yet under favor it is i who in this particular speak for the commonwealth
test2797,my lords i have now been your lords a great deal longer than i should have done
test2798,yang young falling upon this paper of notes deemed the matter of the utmost importance and immediately communicated it to pm who now produced the paper before the house of comms
test2799,the king proposes this difficulty but how can i take offensive war if i have no more money
test2800,you've been making having tried the affections of your people you are absorbed and loose from all rules of government and may do what power will admit
test2801,old mister more's had accepted a pressing invitation from his grandmother and her husband to join the party and with the addition of servants it was a large one
test2802,as they were in no haste and the confinement of a railroad car would be very irksome to the younger children it had been decided to make the journey by water
test2803,there were no sad leave taken to mar the pleasure the children were in wild spirits and all seemed cheerful and happy as they sat or stood upon the deck watching the reeding shore as the vessel steamed out of the harbor
test2804,at length the land had quite disappeared nothing could be seen but the sky overhead and a vast expansion of water all round and the passengers found leisure to turn their attention upon each other
test2805,there are some nice looking people on board mentioned mister traveling and an under tone to his wife
test2806,besides ourselves we added cousin ronald laughing
test2807,yes she answered that little group yonder a young minister and his wife and i suppose
test2808,and what a dear little fellow he is just about the age of our harold i should judge
test2809,do you son was the smiling rejoined her
test2810,he certainly looks as a very nice little boy
test2811,"suppose you and he shake hands, frank"
test2812,i do indeed they are probably relatively few are aware that tobacco is the cause of their ailments
test2813,that doubtless was the case remarked mister dentimmore
test2814,with all my heart if you will step into the gentleman's cabin where there is a light
test2815,he led the way the others are all following and taking out a slip of paper read from it in a distinct tone loud enough to be heard by those are all about him without disturbing the other passengers
test2816,one drop of nicotine extract the tobacco placed on the tongue of the dog will kill him in a minute the hundredth part of a grain pricked under the skin of a man's arm will produce nausea and fainting
test2817,the half a dozen cigars which most smokers use a day contains six or seven grains enough if concentrated and absorbed to kill three men and a pound of tobacco according to its quality contains from one quarter to one and a half ounces
test2818,is it strange then that smokers and chews have a thousand ailments
test2819,that the french polytechnical institute had to prohibit its use on account of its effects upon the mind
test2820,notice the multitude of sudden deaths and see how many are smokers and chewers
test2821,in a small country town seven of these mysterious provisions occurred in the circuit of a mile all directly tracing to tobacco and any physician on a few moments reflection can match this fact by his own observation
test2822,and then such powerful assets produce intense irritations and thirst which water does not quench
test2823,hence a resort to cider and beer
test2824,no sir what know you not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which you have of god and you are not your own
test2825,for you are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods
test2826,we certainly have no right to injure our bodies either by neglect or self induction
test2827,and again i becease you therefore brothers by the mercy of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable to god which is your reasonable service
test2828,it must require a good deal of resolution for one who has become fond of the induction to give it up remarks mr. mister mister
test2829,no doubt no doubt returned mr. little bear but if your right hand in you pull it out and cast it from you for it is profitable for you that of one of your members should perish and not that your whole body should be cast into hell
test2830,there was a pause broken by young horsey who had been watching a group of men gathered about a table at the far end of the room
test2831,they're being gambling yard and i'm afraid that young fellow is being badly flayed by the middle-aged man against the middle-aged man against
test2832,the eyes of the whole party where it turned in that direction
test2833,no sir he is not here
test2834,and the door was slammed violently too
test2835,now the voice came from the sky light above apparently and with a fierce implication the irate gamester ran upon deck and ran hither and there in search of his tormenter
test2836,his victim who had been looking on during the little scene and listening to the mysterious voice in silent wide-eyed wonder and fear now rose quickly his face deathly pale with trembling hands gathered up the money he had staked and hurrying to his state room locked himself in
test2837,what does it mean cried one
test2838,it is a ventriloquist's board of course returned another let's follow and see the fun
test2839,i wonder which of us it is mentioned the first looking hard at our party i don't know but come on
test2840,that fellow nick ward is a noted black lag and ruffin had his nose broken in a fight and is sensitive on the subject was cheating of course
test2841,who asked the mate i've been seen up here though there are some in the steading
test2842,they heard him in silence with a cool plagmatic indifference most exasperating to one in his present mood
test2843,a man of giant size and herculean strength had laid aside his pipe and slowly rising to his feet ceased the scoundrals in his powerful grasp
test2844,let me go yelled ward making a desperate effort to free his arms
test2845,i think no i think you do you from lesson returned to his captain not relaxing his grasp in the least
test2846,the german released his prisoner and the latter sank away with muddled threats and implications upon the head of his charming
test2847,mister lily and mister daily each at a different time sought out young man words intended victim and tried to influence him for good
test2848,yet there was gambling again the second night between ward and several others of his profession
test2849,they kept it till after midnight
test2850,then mister little boar waking from his first sleep and state room nearby thought he would break it up once more
test2851,an intense voiceless excitement possessed the players for the game was a close one and the stakes were very heavy
test2852,they went eagerly over the board each watching with feverish anxiety his companion's movements each casting now and again a gliding eye upon the heap of gold and green green backs that lay between them and at times half stretching out his hand to clutch it
test2853,a deep broan startled them and they spring to their feet pale and trembling with sudden terror each holding his breath and straining his ear to catch a repetition of the dread sound
test2854,but all was silent and after a moment of anxious waiting they sat down to their game again trying to conceal and shake off their fears with the forced natural laugh
test2855,it came from under the table gastard look what's there look you there look yourself
test2856,what can it be been they asked each other
test2857,oh nonsense what fools are we
test2858,it was the last game of cards for that trip
test2859,the captain coming in shortly after the sudden flight of the gambles took charge of the money and the next day restored it to the owners
test2860,elsie's observer eyes it currently became evident that the daily's were in very straightened circumstances
test2861,oh how kind how very kind missus missus daisy said with tears of joy and gratitude we have hardly known how we should meet the most necessary expenses of this trip but have been trying to cast our care upon the lord asking him to provide
test2862,and how wonderfully he has answered our petitions
test2863,elsie answered pressing her hand affectionally are we not not sisters in christ
test2864,he are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus
test2865,he are all one in christ jesus
test2866,we feel my husband and i that we are only the staff of his bounty and because he has said in as much as he have done it to one of the least of these my brothers you have done it to me it is the greatest privilege and delight to do anything for their people
test2867,"when it was the seven hundred and eighteenth night,"
test2868,but he answered needs i must have zaini zabie so now certainly they came up at the door and the maid said who is at the door
test2869,the noise replied kama daughter of arazia the jew say me is alley of kira with you.
test2870,replied the broker's daughter oh thou daughter of a dog
test2871,and having thus islamized she asked him two men in the faith of islam give marriage portions to women or two men to men.
test2872,and she threw down the jew's head before him
test2873,now the cause of her slaying her sayer was as follows.
test2874,"then he set out, rejoicing to return to the barn of the forty."
test2875,so he ate and fell down senseless for the sweet meats were drug with bang whereupon the kasiy bundled him into the sack and made off with him charge and chest and all to the barak of the forty
test2876,presently hassan shumman came out of a clase and said to him have you gotten in the gear oah
test2877,so he told him what had been fallen him and added if i know whether the rascal is gone and where to find the nave i would pay him out
test2878,no is that whither he went?
test2879,answered hassan i know where he is and opening the door of the closet showed him the sweet meat seller within drugged and senseless.
test2880,so i went round about the highways of the city until i met a sweet meat seller and buying his clothes and stock trade and gear for ten dollars did what was done
test2881,quothe rachel whose head is this
test2882,so ally related to him all that had passed from first to last and the caliph said i had not thought you would kill him for that he was a sorcerer
test2883,he replied i have forty ladies but they are in korea.
test2884,and lora had her own pet pets.
test2885,she meant to be scrupulously conscienceful in the administration of a talent and sometimes at church at a sunday when the sermon was particularly awakening she mentally debated a serious question as to whether a new bonsons and a pair of juvan's gloves daily were not sinful but i think she decided that the new bonsons and gloves were on the whole a pardonable weakness as being good for trade
test2886,one morning lora told her husband with a gay love that she was going to victimize him but he was to promise to be patient and bear with her for once in a way
test2887,"i want to see all the pictures, the modern pictures, especially."
test2888,i remember all the rubin's says at the lover for i saw them three years ago when i was staying in paris with grand papa.
test2889,she returned in a little more than ten minutes in the freshest toilette all pale shimmering blue like the spring sky with poor gray gloves and boots and parasol and a bonet that seemed made of asian butterflies
test2890,he was drawing towards the close of this delightful holiday tour and it was a bright sunshine morning early in february but february in paris is sometimes better than april in london.
test2891,but she fixed upon a picture which she said she preferred to anything she had seen in the gallery.
test2892,philip joseph was examining some pictures on the other side of the room when his wife made his discovery.
test2893,how i wish i could get me a copy of that picked to philip lara said in treatingly
test2894,i should so like one to hang in my morning room at jason's rock.
test2895,she turned to the french as presently and asked him where the elder mister coastal lived and if there was any possibility of seeing him
test2896,they have said that he is even a little imibel that he does not remember himself of the most common events of his life.
test2897,but there are some others who say that his memory has not entirely failed and that he is still enough harshly critical towards the works of others.
test2898,i don't think you will have any difficulty in finding the house.
test2899,"you will be doing me such a favor, philip, if you'll say yes."
test2900,he's followers rushed forward to where he lay and their united force compelling the black night to pause they dragged the wounded leader within the walls.
test2901,it was on their journey to that town that they were over taken on the road by seder and his party in which company they were afterwards carried captive to the castle of talkers stone.
test2902,as he lay on his bed wrapped with pain and mental agony and filled with the fear of rapidly approaching death he heard a voice address him
test2903,what are you? he exclaimed in terror.
test2904,leave me and seek the saxons who was my tempests let her as well as i taste the tortures which await hell
test2905,"exclaimed the norman, oh,"
test2906,remember you are the magazine of fuel that it is store beneath these apartments woman
test2907,they are fast rising at least said erica and a signal shall soon wave to warn the beasides to press hard upon those who would exterminate them.
test2908, meanwhile the black night had led his forces again to the attack and so vigorous was their attack that before long the gate of the castle alone separated them from those within
test2909,the defenders finding the castle to be on fire now determined to sell their lives as dearly as they could and headed by the bracey they threw open the gate and were at once involved in a terrible conflict with those outside
test2910,the black night with potential strength force his way into in despite of the bracey and his followers
test2911,two of the foremost they instantly fell and the rest gave way not being all the leader's efforts to stop them.
test2912,the black night was soon engaged in desperate combat with the norman chief and the-volted roof of the hall rang with a furious blows.
test2913,"at length, the bracey fell."
test2914,tell me your name or work your pleasure on me.
test2915,"yet first let me say, said bracey what it implies you to know"
test2916,exclaimed the black night prisoner and perished.
test2917,the life of every man in the castle shall answer it if a hair of his head be singed show me my chamber
test2918,raising the wounded man with ease the black night rushed with it to the postgate and having there delivered his burden to the care of youmen he again entered the castle to assist in the rescue of the other prisoners
test2919,but in other parts thebees pursued the defenders of the castle from chamber to chamber and saturated in their blood the vengeance which had long animated them against the soldiers of the tyrant from the bugh
test2920,as the fire fires to spread rapidly through all parts of the castle urica appeared on one of the turters.
test2921,before long the tower of flames had remounted every obstruction and rose to the evening skies one large and burning beam seen far and white through the adjacent country tower after a tower after tower crashed down with blaze roof and rafte
test2922,at length with a terrible crash the whole tower gave away and she died in the flames which had consumed her tyrant.
test2923,when the outlaws had divided the spoles which they had taken from the castle of torkstone sedered prepare to take his departure.
test2924,he left a gallant band of foresters sorrowing deeply for his lost friend the lord of coningsburg and he and his followers had scared departed when a procession moved slowly from under the greenwood branches in the direction which he had taken in the center of which was the car in which the body of adlans was laid
test2925,to bracey bowed low and in silence threw himself upon a horse and galled off through the wood.
test2926,here is a buggle which an english yowman has once worn i pray you to keep it as a memory of your gallant bearing.
test2927,so saying he mounted his strong warhorse and rode off through the forest.
test2928,during all this time iisac of york sat mournfully apart graving for the loss of his daily love daughter rebecca.
test2929,"and with this essay, and the happy old man set out to procure his daughter's liberation."
test2930,the temple is flared said the bracey in answer to the prince's ego questions from the birth you will never see more and he added in a low and emotional tone richard is in england i have seen him and spoke with him
test2931,he appealed to the bracey to assist him in his project and became at once deeply suspicious of the night's loyalty towards him when he declined to left hand against the man who had spared his own life
test2932,"before reaching his destination he was told that lucas the boamn nour, the grandmaster of the order of the temples was then on visit to the preceptory"
test2933,he had not until then been informed to the presence of the jewish maiden in the abode of the temples and great was his fury and indignation on learning that she was among them
test2934,poor ixas was hurryd off accordingly and expelled from the perception all his entreaties and even his office unheared and disregarded.
test2935,the assurance that she possesses some friend in this awful assembly gave a courage to look around and to mark in whose presence she had been conducted.
test2936,she gazed accordingly upon a scene which might well have struck terror into a bold heart and whose
test2937,at his feet was placed a table occupied by two scribes whose duty was to record the proceedings of the day.
test2938,the preceptors of whom they were four present occupied seats behind the superior's and behind them stood the ascribes of the order robed in white.
