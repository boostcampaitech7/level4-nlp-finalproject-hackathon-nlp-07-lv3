test0000,there's iron they say in all our blood and a grain or two perhaps is good but his he makes me harshly feel has got a little too much of steel an on
test0001,margaret said mister hale as he returned from showing his guests downstairs i could not help watching your face with some anxiety when mister thorton made his confession of having been a shop boy
test0002,you don't mean that you thought me so silly
test0003,i really liked that account of himself better than anything else he said
test0004,his statement of having been a shop boy was the thing i like best of all
test0005,you who were always accusing people of being shabby at helsington.
test0006,i don't think mister hale you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been
test0007,i really was very much afraid of showing him how much shocked i was at some parts of what he said
test0008,his father dying in miserable circumstances
test0009,why it might have been in the workhouse
test0010,his father speculated wildly failed and then killed himself because he could not bear the disgrace
test0011,all his former friends shrank from the disclosures that had to be made of his unjust gambling wild hopeless struggles made with other people's money to regain his own moderate portion of wealth
test0012,no one came forward to help the mother and this boy
test0013,at least no friend came forward immediately and miss thorton is not one i fancy to wait till tardy kindness comes to find her out
test0014,so they liftton
test0015,how tainted asked the father
test0016,oh papa by that testing everything by the standard of wealth
test0017,when he spoke of the mechanical powers he evidently looked upon them only as new ways of extending trade and making money
test0018,and the poor men around him they were poor because they were vicious out of the pale of his sympathies because they had not his own nature and the capabilities that gives him for being rich
test0019,not vicious he never said that
test0020,in providence and self-indulgence were his words
test0021,margaret was collecting her mother's working materials and preparing to go to bed
test0022,just as she was leaving the room she hesitated she was inclined to make an acknowledgement which she thought would please her father but which to be full and true must include a little annoyance
test0023,however out it came
test0024,papa i do think mister thorton a very remarkable man but personally i don't like him at all
test0025,and i do said her father laughing
test0026,personally as you call it and all
test0027,i don't set him up for a hero or anything of that kind
test0028,but good night child
test0029,there were several other signs of something wrong about missus hale
test0030,she and dickson held mysterious consultations in a bedroom from which dickson would come out crying and crossing as was a custom when any distress of her mistress called up on her sympathy
test0031,once margaret had gone into the chamber soon after dickson left it and found her mother on her knees and as margaret stole out she found a few words which were evidently a prayer for strength and patience to endure severe bodily suffering
test0032,but though she received caresses and fine words back again in such profusion as would have gladdened her formally yet she felt that there was a secret withheld from her and she believed it bore serious reference to her mother's health
test0033,she lay awake very long this night planning how to lessen the evil influence of the miltown life on her mother
test0034,a servant to give dickson permanent assistance should be got if she gave up the whole time to the search and then at any rate her mother might have all the personal attention she required and had been accustomed to her whole life
test0035,visiting register offices seeing all manner of unlikely people and very few in the least likely absorbed margaret's time and thoughts for several days
test0036,one afternoon she met bessie hickins in the street and stopped to speak to her
test0037,well bussy how are you?
test0038,better and not better if you know what that means
test0039,not exactly replied margaret smiling
test0040,i'm better in not being torn to pieces by coughing nights but i'm weary and tired of milton and longing to get away to the land of bulgaria and when i think i'm farther and farther off my heart sinks and i'm no better i'm worse
test0041,margaret turned around to walk alongside the girl in her feeble progress homeward
test0042,but for a mineral or two she did not speak
test0043,at last she said in a low voice
test0044,bessie do you wish to die?
test0045,bessie was silent in her turn for a minute or two then she replied
test0046,not worse than many others i reckon
test0047,but what was it?
test0048,you know i'm a stranger here so perhaps i'm not so quick at understanding what you mean as if i'd lived all my life in milton
test0049,i had forgotten what i said for the time continued margaret quietly
test0050,i should have thought of it again when i was less busy may i go with you now
test0051,the sharpness in her eye turned to a wistful longing as she met margaret's soft and friendly gaze
test0052,as they turned up into a small court opening out into a squashed street bessie said
test0053,you will not be daunted by your fathers at home and speaks a bit gruffly at first
test0054,but nicholas was not at home when they entered
test0055,gaspise at last
test0056,bessie took a long and feverish draft and then fell back and shut her eyes
test0057,margaret bent over and said bessie don't be impatient with your life whatever it is or may have been
test0058,remember who gave it to you and made it what it is.
test0059,"now i'll not have my wench preach to,"
test0060,but surely said margaret facing round you believe in what i said that god gave her life and ordered what kind of life it was to be
test0061,i believe what i see and no more
test0062,that's what i believe young woman
test0063,i don't believe all i hear no not by big deal
test0064,but who's come at last and who's welcome as long as he'll keep from preaching on what who knows not about
test0065,it's simple and not far to fetch nor hard to work
test0066,but the girl only played the more with margaret.
test0067,don't think hard on him he's a good man he is
test0068,i sometimes think i shall be murtured with sorrow even in the city of god your ifader is not there
test0069,the feverish color came into a chick and the feverish flame into her eye
test0070,but you will be there father you shall oh my heart
test0071,she put her aunt to it and became gaily pale
test0072,margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to rest upon her bosom
test0073,presently the spasm that foretold death had passed away and bessie roused herself and said
test0074,i'll go to bed its best place but catching at margaret's gown you'll come again i know you will but just say it
test0075,i'll come to morrow said margaret
test0076,margaret went away very sad and thoughtful
test0077,she was late for tea at home
test0078,have you met with a servant dear?
test0079,no ma'am that anne buckley would never have done
test0080,suppose i try said mister hell
test0081,everybody else has had their turn at this great difficulty now let me try
test0082,i may be the cinderella to put on the slipper after all
test0083,"what would you do, papa? how would you set about it?"
test0084,well i i would apply it to some good house mother to recommend me one known to herself or her servants
test0085,very good but we must first catch our house mother
test0086,the mother of whom he spoke to us said marguerite
test0087,mister thorton the only son he has i believe said heller quietly
test0088,i shall like to see her she must be an uncommon person her mother added
test0089,perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us and be glad of our place
test0090,she sounded to be such a careful economic person that i should like anyone out of the same family
test0091,my dear said mister hell alarmed pray don't go off on that idea
test0092,i'm sure at any rate she would not like strangers to know anything about it
test0093,take notice that this is not my kind of fortunatus if i have any at all which i do not agree to you though you are always accusing me of it
test0094,i don't know positively that it is hers either but from little things i have gathered from him i fancy so
test0095,they cared too little to ask in what manner her son had spoken about her
test0096,if called to a case supposed to be one of poisoning the medical man has two duties to perform to save the patient's life and to place himself in a position to give evidence called on to do so
test0097,he should make inquiries as to symptoms and time at which fruit or medicine was last taken
test0098,he should notice the position and temperature of the body the condition of rigor mortis marks of violence appearance of lips and mouth
test0099,in making a post mortem examination the elementary canal should be removed and preserved for further investigation
test0100,the gut and the gallbladder being cut across between these ligaments the stomach may be removed entirely without spilling its contents
test0101,if the medical practitioner is in doubt on any point he should obtain technical assistance from someone who has paid attention to the subject
test0102,in a case of attempted suicide by poisoning is it the duty of the doctor to inform the police
test0103,the best amatic is that which is at hand
test0104,the days for an infant are ten minutes
test0105,ephemeris is not allied with physiological action to morphine and may be given in cases of narcotic poisoning
test0106,ticking the forces with a fiddle make side vomiting
test0107,in using the elastic stomach tube some fluid should be introduced into the stomach before attempting to empty it or a portion of the mucous membrane may be sucked into the aperture
test0108,the tube should be examined to see that it is not broken or cracked as accidents have happened from neglecting this precaution
test0109,anatomies are usually given hypothermically or if their mouth in the form of tablets
test0110,in the absence of a hypodermic syringe the remedy may be given by the rectum
test0111,noticed the small color and general appearance of the matter submitted for examination
test0112,for the separation of an alkaloid the following is the process of stas otto
test0113,this process is based upon the principle that the salts of the alkaloids are soluble in alkaline water and insoluble in ether
test0114,the pure alcohols with the exception of morphine in its crystalline form are soluble in ether
test0115,two cool the mixture and filter wash the residue with strong alcohol and mix the filtrates
test0116,the residue may be set aside for the detection of the metallic poisons if suspected expel the alcohol by careful evaporation
test0117,on the evaporation of the alcohol the wizeness and fatty matters separate
test0118,evaporate the filtrate to a syringe and extract with successive portions of absolute alcohol
test0119,separate the ethereal solution and reaprate
test0120,five a part of this ethereal solution is poured into a watch glass and allowed to evaporate
test0121,to purify it add a small quantity of dilute sulfuric acid and after evaporating to three quarters of its bulk add a saturated solution of carbonate of potash or soda
test0122,boil the finely divided substance with about one eighth its bulk of pure hydrochloric acid from time to time potassium chlorate until the solids are reduced to a yellow fluid
test0123,the residue of the material after digestion with hydrochloric acid and potassium chlorate may have to be examined for silver led and barium
test0124,"a thousand blessings from a grateful heart,"
test0125,peruse said the pony brooker that's the way to pronounce it
test0126,his books told him that treasure is best hidden under loose boards and as of course your house has a secret panel which he had not
test0127,he got it up and pushed his treasures as far in as he could along the rough crumbling surface of the lars and plaster
test0128,when dickie came down his aunt slightly slapped him and he took the half penny and limped off obediently
test0129,he had never seen one before and it interested him extremely
test0130,he looked at him and knew that he did not at all know where he was
test0131,what's matey lost your way dickie explained
test0132,when he said have i ever been asleep
test0133,here we all set them in
test0134,not exactly said them but it's all right
test0135,when it was over the man asked dickie if he could walk a little way and when dickie said he could they set out in the most friendly way side by side
test0136,and the tea and all and the egg
test0137,and this is the prettiest place ever i see
test0138,i should catch it a fair one as it is
test0139,she was waiting for the water to boil the kitten when it came out mother
test0140,and bad when she's in a good temple
test0141,that and not she'll be in when you get back
test0142,i got a ticket said diggy sadly i'd best be getting home

test0145,i ended it have i like what you're on

test0147,the man's manner was so kind and tatty the whole adventure was so wonderful and new is it country where are you going
test0148,the sun long golden beams through the gaps in the hatch
test0149,a bird paused in its flight on the branch quite close and clung their swing
test0150,he took out of his pocket in a new envelope a new sheet of paper and a new pencil ready sharpened by machinery
test0151,and i asked you let me come along you got that
test0152,get it down then done
test0153,then he folded it and put it in his pocket
test0154,now a square he said
test0155,they could put a man away for less than that
test0156,i see that there in the book i took it said i
test0157,he rewarded the wake the last of the english and i wondered what it stood for
test0158,white and half the size of a lea
test0159,adventures i should think so
test0160,ah said dicky and a full silence fell between them
test0161,that was charming but it was pleasant too to wash the madam of the wet grass
test0162,dicky always remembered that moment
test0163,so you shall said mister biel a regular wash all over this very night i always like to wash myself
test0164,some folks think it pays to be dirty but it doesn't
test0165,if you are clean they say honest poverty and if you are dirty they say serve you right
test0166,you are good said ticky i do like you
test0167,i know you will dickie with enthusiasm i know how good you are
test0168,bless me said mister beale uncomfortably well there
test0169,step out sunny or we'll never get there this same day of christmas
test0170,well you'll know all about it presently
test0171,the singing and laughing when john long after he had fallen asleep and if later in the evening there were allowed voiced arguments or quarrels even dickie did not hear them
test0172,what's on that there dickie asked pointing to the odd nobly bundled of all sorts and shapes tied on to the preeminentate's front
test0173,tell you what maid it looks to me as if i took a fancy to you
test0174,swear me he said helplessly
test0175,oh look the digger the flowers
test0176,there are only weeds said beil
test0177,but i shall have them where they are alive said dickie as he had said to the pawnbroker about the moonflowers
test0178,hi there goes a rabbit
test0179,"yes, this verity, yes,"
test0180,how beautiful said dickie riddling with delight
test0181,this life of the rabbit as described by mister beil was the child's first glimpse of freedom i'd like to be a rabbit
test0182,i am to wear in the room in prime if you go on like as if you were a beggar of fields
test0183,i like you next my own father and mister back's next door
test0184,that's all right said mister beilew awkwardly
test0185,dicky quixotified touched his
test0186,poor little man said the lady you miss your mother don't you
test0187,oh well done little one said beaumont to himself
test0188,the two travelers were left facing each other the richer by a penny and oh wonderful good fortune a whole half crown
test0189,no i never said ticky here's the steele
test0190,you stick to that said a radiant with delight you are a fair masterpiece you earned it honest if a kid done
test0191,they went up on the hill as happy as any one need wish to be
test0192,please do not be too shocked
test0193,remember that neither of them knew any better
test0194,to the elder tramp lies and begging were natural means of livelihood
test0195,but you said the bed was with the green curtains earnestly
test0196,which this end not by any means
test0197,the night is full of interesting little sounds that will not at first let you sleep the rustle of little white things in the hatches the barking of dogs in distant farms the chirp of crickets and the quacking of frogs
test0198,the new game of bagging and inventing stories to interest the people from whom it was worth while to bag were on galey day by day and week by week and dicky by constant practice so became clever at taking his part in the acting that mister beil was quite dazed with admiration
test0199,blessed if i ever see such a nipper he said over and over again
test0200,clever as a train dog is and all out of its own net
test0201,i am sure as i better not stick to the road and keep away from old friends like you jim
test0202,i hope he's clever enough to do what he's told keep his mugshot that's all
test0203,if he's straight you'll do for me and in the end i'll do for him see
test0204,see that bloke now said mister beile yes said diggy
test0205,well you never see him
test0206,if anyone asked you if you ever saw him you never saw eyes on him in all your born not to remember him
test0207,dicky was full of questions but master billy had no answers for them
test0208,no was it sunday on which they took a rest and washed their shirts according to mister beild's rule of life
test0209,they did not stay there but walked out across the dawns with the skylarks singing and on a dip of the dawns came upon great stone walls and towers very strong and gray
test0210,what's that there said diggy
test0211,replied he of a truth i heard him not and i want him not and people are all sleeping
test0212,but she said whomsoever thou seest awake he is the reciter
test0213,then said the unicorn are thou he who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him
test0214,rejoined the unicorn who then was the reciter point him out to me
test0215,by ala replied the fireman i tell you the truth
test0216,tell me what happened what's amakan
test0217,what ales did then that thou must needs recite verses seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the folk are asleep for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue
test0218,and he also improvised the two following these stitches
test0219,when notah alzamah heard the first improvisation she called to mine father and her mother and her brother and their willow home then she wept and cried to the yunuk and said to him woe to thee
test0220,he who recited the first time has recited a second time and i heard him hard by
test0221,by alah and thou fetch him not to me i will assuredly rouse the chamberlain on thee and he shall beat thee and cast thee out
test0222,but take these hundred diners and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently and do him no hurt
test0223,return quickly and linger not
test0224,when it was the seventy third night
test0225,but the yonok said i will not leave thee till i show you who it was that recited the verses for i dread returned to my lady without him
test0226,now when the fireman heard these words he feared for zawal amkan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the unit by allah it was not i and i know him not
test0227,so go thou to thy station and if thou again meet any one after this hour reciting otho of poetry whether he be near or far it will be i or someone i know and thou shall not learn of him but by me
test0228,then he kissed the yonock's head and spoke him fair till he went away but the castro fetched around and returned secretly came and stood behind the fireman fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings
test0229,i say what made my ignorance whatever the bitter cup i drain far by from me that land to flee nor will i bow to those who blame and for such love would i deal me shame
test0230,then said the yukon to zavalokan peace be with you my lord
test0231,oh my lord continued the yonok and sherasad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
test0232,we will do thee no wrong my son nor wrong thee in not but our object is that thou bend thy grievous steps with me to my mistress to receive her answer and returning will and safety and thou shall have a handsome present as one who brings good news
test0233,then the yukon went out to zaoalman and said to him read what verses thou knowest for my ladies here hard by listening to thee and after i will ask thee of thy name and thy native country and thy condition
test0234,and also these
test0235,then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twain fell down in a fainting fit
test0236,when the yonoks saw his case he wondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them waited till they should recover
test0237,after a while they came to themselves and azud al saman rejoiced with exceeding joy oppression and depression left her and gladness took the mastery of her and she repeated these verses
test0238,accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the kan and what had happened to her with the badawi how the merchant had bought her of him and had taken her to her brother shirkan and had sold her to him how he had freed her at the time of buying how he had made her marriage contract with her and had gone into her and how the king their sayer had
test0239,but now go to thy master and bring him quickly to me
test0240,the chambertin called the castro and charged him to do accordingly so he replied i hear and i obey and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the stoker till he found him in the rear of the carriage girding his ess and preparing for flight
test0241,she said it hath reached me oh auspicious king when that the scoundrel girted his ass for flight and besought himself saying oh would i know what he is become of him
test0242,i believe he has denounced me to the yonok hence these pages at about me and he has made me an accomplice in his crime
test0243,why didst thou say i never repeated these couplets nor do i know who repeated them when it was thy companion
test0244,but now i will not leave thee between this place and badde and what betide thee thy comrade shall be tied thee
test0245,it was as i feared the coming calamities discerning but on to a law we are all returning
test0246,then the unicorn cried upon his pages saying take him off the ass
test0247,and he answered i am the chambertin of the emir of damaskos king shirkan song of omar ben al nouman lord of baghdad and of the land of khorasan and i bring tribute and presents from him to his father in baghdad
test0248,so fair and forward no harm shall befall you till you join his grand vizier then done
test0249,then he bade him be seated and questioned him and he replied that he was churningling to the emperor of damascus and was bound to king omar with presents and the tribute of syria
test0250,so it was agreed that we go to damaskus and fetch dens the king's son shirkan and make him sultan over his father's realm
test0251,and among them were some who would have chosen the cadet zawa al macan for quoth the day his name be light of the place and he hath a sister nusa al salman hays the delight of the time but they set out five years ago for al jazah and none woteth what has become of them
test0252,so he turned to the vizier dan and said to him verily your tale is a wonder of wonders
test0253,now oh chief justice that here where you have encountered me allah has given you rest from fatigue and brings it to you your desire after the easiest of fashions for that his almighty will restored it to you zao ma kan and his sister nusa al zalam whereby we will settle the matter as we easily can
test0254,when the minister heard these words he rejoiced with great joy and said oh chambertin tell me the tale of the twain and what befell them and the cause of their long absence
test0255,zawa makhan bowed his head a while and then said i accept the position for indeed there was no refusing and he was certified that the chamberlain had counselled him well and wisely and set him on the right way
test0256,then he added oh my uncle how shall i do with my brother sharkan
test0257,after a while the dust dispersed and air appeared under it the army of badghad and korsan a conquering host like the pool tide sea and chazrad perceived the dawn of day and insisted to say her permitted say
test0258,when it was a seventy eighth night
test0259,and in it all rejoiced at the ascension of the light of the place
test0260,lastly the minister went in and kissed the ground before zao alamkan who rose to meet him saying welcome o wazir and siyrs son pier
test0261,moreover the sultan commanded his vizier dan call at ten days halt of the army that he may be private with him and learn from him how and wherefore his father had been slain
test0262,he then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host to halt ten days
test0263,what has happened to me
test0264,he asked himself something warm and living quickening me it must be in the neighbourhood
test0265,when however the roustav was quite nai into them then did he hear plainly let human voice speak in the midst of the kind and apparently all of them had turned their heads towards the speaker
test0266,who do i hear seek
test0267,answered he the same that thou seekest thou mischievous maker that is to say happiness upon earth
test0268,for i tell thee that i have already talked half a morning unto them and just now were they about to give me their answer
test0269,he would not be rid of his affliction
test0270,who hath not at present his heart his mouth and his eyes full of disgust
test0271,dawalso dawalso
test0272,but behold this kind
test0273,the kin however gave at it all and wondered
test0274,wanted an audacity beileus envy care borne revenge popular pride all this struck me eye
test0275,it is no longer true that the poor are blessed
test0276,the kingdom of heaven however is with the kind and why is it not with the rich
test0277,why didst thou captivate me
test0278,answered so the other
test0279,thou knowest it thyself better even than i
test0280,thus beg the peaceful one and puffed himself and puffed himself and puffed himself so that the kind one wunder'd a new
test0281,thou doest violence to thyself thou preacher on the mount and thou usesst such savoury words
test0282,they also abstain from all heavy thoughts which inflame the heart
test0283,well
test0284,sine utreque thou shouldst also see my animals my eagle and my serpent their like do not at present exist on earth
test0285,and talk to mind animals of the happiness of animals
test0286,now however take leave at once of their kind thou strange one
test0287,thou amiable one
test0288,for they are thy warmest friends and perspectives
test0289,doe ever leter
test0290,with her head my loneliness called he spoke
test0291,my shadow calls to me
test0292,what matter about my shadow
test0293,let it run after me i run away from it
test0294,and thus he was to strike to his heart and ran away
test0295,vereilly my folly has grown big in the mountains
test0296,now do i hear six old fools' legs rattling behind one another
test0297,but doth austerus need to be frightened by his shadow
test0298,also i think it that after all it has long or less than mine
test0299,who when their twitches screeched him with his glance he was frightened as by a sudden appearance so slender sartorius hollow and worn out did his follower appear
test0300,as a twister vehemently what do you stand here
test0301,and why call it thou that i served my shadow
test0302,the ward not pleasing into me
test0303,must i ever be on the way
test0304,oh art thou hath become to round for me
test0305,when the devil casteth his skin does not his name also fall away it is also skin
test0306,the devil himself is perhaps skin
test0307,sometimes i meant to lie and behold
test0308,then only did i hit that truth
test0309,how have i still inclinations
test0310,have i still a goal
test0311,i have no doubt in which my sale is set
test0312,for it do i ask and seek and i have sought but have not found it
test0313,oh eternal everywhere oh eternal nowhere oh eternal in vain
test0314,thou art my shadow
test0315,said he it alas sadly
test0316,thy danger is not small thy free spirit and wanderer
test0317,they sleep quietly they enjoy their new security
test0318,be wary lest in the end a narrow faith capture thee a hard and rigid delusion
test0319,for now everything that is narrow and fixed seduce it and tempt it day
test0320,thou has lost thy rule
test0321,thou poor rover and ramble thou tired but to fly
test0322,will thou have a rest in a home this evening
test0323,once upon a time a brahmin who was walking along the road came upon an iron cage in which a great tiger was shut up by the villagers who caught him
test0324,the brahmin answered no i will not for if i let you out of the cave you will eat me
test0325,oh father of mercy answered the tiger in truth that i will not
test0326,i will never be so ungrateful only let me out that i may drink some water and return
test0327,then the braman pitied him and opened the cage door but no sooner had he done so that the tiger jumping out said now i will eat you first and drink the water afterwards
test0328,so the brahmin and the tiger walked on till they came to a abandoned tree and the brahmin said to it abandoned tree abandoned tree hear and give judgment
test0329,on what must i give judgment as the abandoned tree
test0330,this tiger said the brahmin begged me to let him out of his cage to drink a little water and he promised not to hurt me if i did so but now that i have left him out he wishes to eat me
test0331,it is just that he should do so or no
test0332,let the tiger eat the man for men are an ungrateful race
test0333,sir camel sir camel cried the brahmin hear and give judgment
test0334,at a little distance they found a bullock lying by the road side
test0335,is it fair that he should do so or not
test0336,let the tiger eat the man for men have no pity
test0337,three out of the six and giving judgment against the brahmin yet still he did not lose all hope and determined to ask the other three
test0338,on what must i give judgment said the evil
test0339,the brahmin said the case and the eagle answered whenever men see me they try to shoot me they climb the rocks and steal away my little ones
test0340,then the tiger began to roar and said judgment of all is against you oh barman
test0341,after this they saw an allegorist and the brahmin related the matter to him hoping for a more favorable verdict
test0342,but the alligator said whenever i put my nose out of the water men torment me and try to kill me
test0343,the brahmin gave himself up as lost but again he prayed the tiger to have patience and let him ask the opinion of the sixth judge
test0344,now the sixth was a jackalow
test0345,the brahmin told his story and said to him uncle jackal uncle jackal say what is your judgment
test0346,show me the pace
test0347,when they got there the jackal said now brahman show me exactly where you stood
test0348,exactly there was it asked jacko
test0349,exactly here replied the brahmin
test0350,where was the tiger then
test0351,why i stood so said the tiger jumping into the cage and my head was on this side
test0352,very good said jeckow but i cannot judge without understanding the whole matter exactly
test0353,shut and bolted said the bramlin
test0354,then shut and bolted set the jackhole
test0355,when the brahmin had done this the jackal said oh you wicked and ungrateful tiger
test0356,when a good braman opened your cage door is to eat him the only return you would make
test0357,proceed on your journey friend fridamann
test0358,your road lies that way and mind this
test0359,and thus accomplished he excited the admiration of every silly quokka and the envy of every fluttering quokka but by all young gentlemen and ladies of understanding he was hardly dispossessed as a mere civilized monkey
test0360,that his soul might afterwards occupy such an estate as would be most suitable to his character it was intense to inhabit the body of that finicky grinning and mitchell's little mimic with full legs which you now behold before you
test0361,the moors was afraid and said surely that thing is known
test0362,hold on hold fast hold fast hold fast hold fast hold fast hold fast hold fast hold fast hold fast hold fast hold fast hold fast hold fast
test0363,let's have faith that right makes might and in that faith let's there to do our duty if you understand it lincoln
test0364,the egyptian background of the bondage
test0365,every one who's perturb'd has been found by gideon's path the testimony of the oldest biblical narratives regarding the sojourn of the hebrews in egypt is also in perfect accord with the picture which the contemporary egyptian scripts give the period
test0366,the absence of detailed reference to the hebrews is therefore perfectly natural
test0367,it seems probable that not all but only part of the tribes whose ultimate caravans into the hebrew nation found their way to egypt
test0368,the stories regarding joseph their traditional father ephraim and manasseh imply that these strong central tribes possibly together with the southern tribes of benjamin and judah were the chief actors in its opening scene in israel's history
test0369,the biblical narratives apparently disagree regarding the duration of the sojourn in egypt
test0370,the later traditions tend to extend the period
test0371,he was found several inscriptions bearing the egyptian name of the city patum house of the god atum
test0372,contemplative scripts and also states that he found it near pitthum the house of ramses a city with the royal residents and temples
test0373,that the hebrews were oppressed under this serfdom was naturally inevitable
test0374,was any other procedure to be expected from it the despondent roar of that land and bay
test0375,the making of a loyal patriot
test0376,the story of mohammed's birth in early childhood is one of the most interesting chapters in biblical history
test0377,which moves it justified and resists the gypsy's tax master
test0378,its penguins always disasters not only to its victims but also to the government imposing it
test0379,nautical he winks in land of medina
test0380,the wilderness to the east of egypt had for centuries been the plates of refuge for egyptians fugitives
test0381,from about tuesday and bisey
test0382,on the borders of the wilderness he found certain bedouin herdsman who received him hospitably
test0383,these stern wanderers sent him on from trime to trime until he reached the land of kedimah each of the dead sea where he remained for a year and a half
test0384,later he found his way to the court of one of the local kings in central palestine where he married and became in the time a prosperous local prince
test0385,the scale of the weanits
test0386,the story of mohammed is in many ways closely parallel to that of the prophet
test0387,the priest the sub tribe of the kanites received him into his home and gave him his daughter in marriage
test0388,note the carefree and oriental idea of marriages
test0389,here moses learned the lessons that were essential for his training as a leader and the deliverer of his people
test0390,after the capture of jericho certain of them went up with the southern tribes to conquer southern palestine
test0391,many modern scholars drew the conclusion from the biblical narrative that it was from the kinnites that moses first learned of yahweh or as the distinctive name of israel's god was translated by later judaism
test0392,do the urythian seboe traditions imply that the ancestors of the israelites were worshippers of god
test0393,the title of his funded law implies that this priest ministered at some wilderness sanctuary
test0394,jesus in the home of the minyans the priest was brought into direct and constant contact with the jehovah worship
test0395,the cruel fate of his people and the painful experience in egypt that had driven him into the wilderness prepared his mind to receive this training
test0396,his quest was for a jet and a strong gun able to deliver the oppressed
test0397,the wilderness with its sullen foes and the ever present dread of hunger and thirst deepens into a sense of need and of dependence upon the power able to guide the destitute needs of man
test0398,the persons of the vats antonin and glen of central asia minor still will call every life giving spring god has given
test0399,the constant necessity amid meeting the dangers of the wilderness and the defending the flocks entranced to moses care developed his courage in power of leadership in action
test0400,evidently the intention was to make things present for the royal folk a tobacco house during his visit
test0401,the proverbs and the regulative clause that a smoking in saint mary's church referred it may be noted to the act which was held therein
test0402,sometimes tobacco is used in church for disinfecting or deodorizing purposes
test0403,blackburn arcturus sip of york who was a great smoker
test0404,on one occasion he was at saint mary's church newhaven for a confirmation
test0405,another eighteenth century clerical worthy the famous doctor par and an enfeebled smoker was accustomed to do what mister disney prevented arches at blackburn from doing he smoked in his vester at hattin
test0406,par was such a continuous smoker that any one who came into his company if he had never smoked before and to learn the use of a pipe as a means of self defense
test0407,one sunday said mister ditchfield he had a nectarine pipe and joshua the clerk told him that the people were getting impatient
test0408,them i'm singing another songs said the curate
test0409,they have said sir repton clerk
test0410,let them sing the hundred and nineteenth part of the curate
test0411,six arms the near within reach presented with an obedient start as many tobacco pouches to the man of office
test0412,david dean savored not at all improved this irreverence
test0413,going to church saint hayes in those days must have been quite in the inspiring experience
test0414,when these men in the course of my remonstrances found out that it was not going to continue the case they no longer cared to be communicants
test0415,parrots in that quarter were used distressing by the sipes is true but the c s for them far more are innocent than are guilty of any acts of violence
test0416,now or after the sun had set the wind fell to unlight air that just kept steered way on the ship
test0417,fortunately the john was not only fat but she minded her helm as a light footed girl turns into a lively dance
test0418,i never was in a better steering sip posthumous and moderate weather
test0419,mister marble he had to believe was fairly snoozing on the hiccups being like the cells as one might say very asleep
test0420,at that moment i heard a noise we were familiar to see men that of an oar falling in the boat
test0421,saying sail ho and close abroad
test0422,he was too much of a seaman to require a second look in order to assert a certain but was to be done
test0423,although they went three feet to two this gave us a moment of breathing time
test0424,as our seats were off lying forward and remained so for a few minutes it gave me a leisure to look about
test0425,i soon saw both both pricks and grudgingly was i to perceive that they had not approached materially near
test0426,mister cait deserved this so often remarked that our movements had been so prompt as to take the rascal as a back
test0427,a prefect's stillness succeeded
test0428,the prophets did not alter the course but neared not fast
test0429,i heard the raving of the boarding pates too as they were cut a drift from the sponge broom and fell upon the decks
test0430,kite flew out and returned with three or four mussels and as many pipes
test0431,the stillness that rain on both sides was like that of death
test0432,the creature behaved beautifully he came lounging like a cat
test0433,the question was now whether we could pass them or not before they got near up to grapple
test0434,the captain behaved perfectly well in its critical instance commanding a dead silence and the closest attention to his orders
test0435,oh so alone bored the john was heart
test0436,on our side we gave the gentlemen the four sextons two at the nearest and two at the sternmost proa which was still near a cable's length to it
test0437,they were like the ayes of feigned in england
test0438,i doubt if we touched the man in the near vicinity
test0439,in that state the ship passed ahead all of her canvas spread full leaving the proa moaning in her wake
test0440,they swarmed up in front of shirmer's pailings as thick as they could jam together and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise
test0441,someday out tear down the fence tear down the fence
test0442,the stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable
test0443,sherman ran his eye slow along the crowd and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out gaze him but they couldn't they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky
test0444,the average men are coward
test0445,because they're afraid the man's friends will shoot them in the back in the dark and it's just what they would do
test0446,so they always quitted and then a man goes in the night with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal
test0447,you didn't want to come
test0448,but a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness
test0449,now leave and take your half a man with you tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this
test0450,the crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearing off every which way and buck harkins he healed it after them looking tolerant cheap
test0451,you can't be too careful
test0452,they argued and tried to keep him out but he wouldn't listen and a whole show came to a standstill
test0453,and one or two women began to scream
test0454,so then the ring master he made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he would let him ride if he could think he could stay on the horse
test0455,it wasn't funny to me though i was all of a tremble to see his danger
test0456,and the horse is going like a house of fire too
test0457,he shed him so thick they kind of clogged up the air and altogether he shed seventeen suits
test0458,why it was one of his own men
test0459,and but not remember the rest of his outfit it was just wild but it was awful funny
test0460,the people most killed themselves laughing and when the king got done capering and capering off behind the scenes they roared and clapped and stormed and ho ho ho till he came back and done it over again and after that they made him do it another time
test0461,twenty people sing out
test0462,the duke says yes
test0463,everybody sings out sold
test0464,but a big fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts hold on
test0465,just a word gentlemen they stopped to listen
test0466,what we want is to go out here quiet and talk this show up and sell the rest of the town
test0467,you bet it is the judge is right everybody sings out
test0468,we struck the raft at the same time and in less than two seconds we were gliding down stream all dark and still and edging towards the middle of the river nobody saying a word
test0469,we never showed the light till we were about ten miles below the village
test0470,green horns flat heads
test0471,no i say it don't
test0472,well it don't because it's in debt i reckon they're all a lot
test0473,well that's what i'm a saying all kings are mostly rascals as far as i can make out is that so
test0474,and look at charles second and louis fourteen and louis fifteen and james second and edward second and richard third and forty more besides all those saxons heptarchies that used to rip up so in old times and rae's gain
test0475,may you are to seeing old henry the eight when he was in bloom he was a blossom
test0476,ring up fair rossman
test0477,well henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country
test0478,suppose he opened his mouth what then
test0479,all i say is kings is kings and you got to make allowances
test0480,take them all around there are a mighty ornery lock it's the way they are raised
test0481,well they all do chum
test0482,now to duke he's a tolerant like the man in some ways
test0483,this one's a middle and hard lot for a duke
test0484,when i woke up just a day break he was sitting there with his head bent down twisted to his knees moaning and moaning to himself
test0485,it doesn't seem natural but i reckon so
test0486,he was often moaning and mourning at that night when he judged i was asleep and saying po little lisbeth
test0487,don't you hear me shut that do
test0488,i lay i make you mine
test0489,just as loud as i could yell
test0490,which was sound enough judgment but you take the average man and he wouldn't wait for him to how
test0491,the king's duds was all black and he did look real swell and starchy
test0492,why before he looked like the ornery old rip that ever was but now when he took off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile he looked that grand and good and pious that you say he had walked right out of the ark and maybe was old leviathan himself
test0493,jim cleaned up the canoe and i got my paddle ready
test0494,where are you bound for young man
test0495,get aboard says the king
test0496,i did so and then we all three started on again
test0497,the young chap was mighty thankful said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather
test0498,he asked the king where he was going and the king told him he would come down the river and landed at the other village this morning and now he was going up a few miles to see an old friend on a farm up there the young fellow says
test0499,but then i say again no i reckon he ain't him or else he wouldn't be paddling up the river you ain't him are you
test0500,no my name is blagot alexander blagot reverend alexander blagot i suppose i must say as i am one of the large poor servants
test0501,you see he was pretty old and george's guillotine was too young to be much company for him except mary jane the redheaded one and so he was kind and lonely after george and his wife died and didn't seem to care much to live
test0502,too bad too bad he couldn't have lived to see his brothers poor soul
test0503,i'm going in a ship next wednesday for rory jennaro where my uncle is
test0504,but it'll be lovely wished i was going
test0505,mary janes nineteen susan's fifteen and joanna's about fourteen that's the one that gives herself to good works and has a hairlip poor things
test0506,well they could be worse off
test0507,old peter had friends and they ain't gonna let them come to no harm
test0508,blamed if he did not quarrel about every one and everything in that blessed town and all about the wickses and about peter's business which was a tanner and about george's which was a carpenter and about harvies which was a discenting minister and so on and so on then he says
test0509,when they're deep they won't stop for a hell
test0510,was peter wilske well off
test0511,when we struck the boat she was about done loading and pretty soon she got off
test0512,now hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the new carpet bags
test0513,so then they waited for a steamboat
test0514,that the king was calm he says
test0515,they gave a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to say would you tell you
test0516,then one of them says kind of soft and gentle
test0517,phelps was one of these little one horse cotton plantations and they all look alike
test0518,i went around and climbed over the back style by the ash hopper and started for the kitchen
test0519,i out with a yes and four i thought
test0520,so then she started for the house leading me by the hand and the children tagging after
test0521,when we got there she set me down in a split bottom chair and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me holding both of my hands and says
test0522,well it's lucky because sometimes people get hurt
test0523,and i think he died afterwards he was a baptist
test0524,yes it was mortification that was it
test0525,your uncle's been up to the town every day to fetch you
test0526,you must have met him on the road didn't you old man with a
test0527,watch out it'll be stolen
test0528,it was kind of thin ice but i says
test0529,i had my mind on the children all the time i wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little and find out who i was
test0530,pretty soon she made the cold chill strike all down my back because she says
test0531,i see it wasn't a bit of use to go ahead i'd got to throw up my hand
test0532,so i say to myself here's another place where i got to rest the truth
test0533,i opened my mouth to begin but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed and says here it comes
test0534,children don't you say a word
test0535,i see i was in a fix now
test0536,mrs. phelps she jumped for him and says
test0537,has he come no says her husband
test0538,i can't imagine said the old man and i must say it makes me dreadful easy
test0539,uneasy she says i'm ready to go distracted
test0540,he must have come and you've missed him along the road
test0541,oh don't distress me any more and i'm already distressed
test0542,why silas look yonder up the road ain't that somebody coming
test0543,the old gentleman stared and says
test0544,i ain't no idea who it is
test0545,it's tom soyer
test0546,being tom soyer was easy and comfortable and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by i hear a steamboat coughing along down the river
test0547,then i say to myself suppose time soare comes down on that boat
test0548,but i am hugely pleased that you have seen my lady
test0549,i knew you could not choose but like her yet but let me tell you you have seen but the worst of her
test0550,her conversation has more charms and can be in mere beauty and a humour and disposition would make a deformed person appear lovely
test0551,why did you not send me this news and a garland
test0552,well the best on it is that i have a squier now that is as good as a knight
test0553,in earnest we have had such a scramble and upon so foolish an occasion as i cannot tell which strangers
test0554,all the people that i had ever in my life refused were brought again upon the stage like richard the third ghosts to reproach me with all the kindnesses of his discoveries could make me had for you was laid to my charge
test0555,my best qualities if i have any that are good served but for aggravations of my fault and i was allowed to have wit and understanding and discretion in other things that it might appear i had none in this
test0556,it's a strange change and i'm very sorry for it but i swear i know not how to help it
test0557,mister fish is a squaw of daines and has so many mistresses that any body may pretend to share in him and be believed though i have the honor to be his near neighbour to speak freely i cannot brag much that he makes any account to me and i know no young woman in the country that he does not visit often
test0558,i think my youngest comes down with him
test0559,i can no sooner give you some little hints wherever they live but you know them presently and i meant you should be beholding to me for your acquaintance
test0560,but it seems this gentleman is not so easy access but you may acknowledge something due to me if i incline him to look graciously upon you and therefore there is not much harm done
test0561,i have missed four fits and i have but had five and have recovered so much strength as made me venture to meet your letter on wednesday a mile from home
test0562,but besides i can give you others
test0563,i am here much more out of people's way than in town where my aunt and such as pretend and interest in me and a power over me do so persecute me with your dear good nature and take it so ill that they are not accepted as i would live in a hollow tree to avoid them
test0564,you will think him altered and if it might be possible more melancholy than he was
test0565,if marriage agrees no better with other people than it does with him i shall pray that all my friends may escape it
test0566,well in honest if i was a prince that lady should be my mistress but i can give no rule to anyone else and perhaps those that are in no danger of losing their hearts to her may be infinitely taken with one i should not value it at all for so says the justinian wise providence has ordained it that by their different humans everybody may find something to please themselves with out enviousing each other
test0567,the matter is not great for i confess i do naturally hate the noise and talk of the world and should be best pleased never to be known in it upon any occasion whatsoever yet since it can never be wholly avoided one must satisfy oneself by doing nothing that one need care who knows
test0568,if i had a picture that would fit for you you should have it
test0569,how can you talk of defrauding fortune nobody lives without it and therefore why should you imagine you could
test0570,i know not how my brother comes to be so well informed as you say but i am certain he knows yetmost of the injuries you have received from her
test0571,we have had another debate but much more calmly
test0572,and besides there was a time when we ourselves were indifferent to one another did i do so then or have i learned it since
test0573,i have been studying how tom chick might come by his intelligence and i very well believe he has it from my cousin peter's
test0574,how kindly do i take your disabilities of your fathers in earnest you cannot imagine how his letter pleased me
test0575,would it would leave me and then i could believe i shall not always have occasion for it
test0576,my poor lady vavasor is carried to the tower and her great belly could not excuse her because she was acquainted by somebody that there was a plot against the protector and did not discover it
test0577,she has told now all that was told her but vows she will never say from whence she had it we shall see whether her resolutions are as unalterable as those of my lady talmash
test0578,i wonder how she behaved herself when she was married
test0579,i never saw anyone yet that did not look simply and out of countenance no one knew a wedding well designed but one and that was of two persons who were at time enough i confessed to contrive it and nobody to please in themselves
test0580,the truth is i could not endure to be missus bride in a public wedding to be made the happiest person on earth
test0581,do not take it ill for i would endure it if i could rather than fail but in earnest i do not think it was possible for me
test0582,yet in honest your father will not find my brother paten wanting in civility though he is not a man of much compliment unless it be in his letters to me nor an unreasonable person in anything so he will allow him out of his kindness to his wife to set a higher value upon her sister and she desires
test0583,my aunt told me no longer gone than yesterday that i was the most willing woman that ever she knew and had an obstinacy of spirit nothing could overcome take heed
test0584,you see i give you fair warning
test0585,by the next i shall have gone to kent and my other journeys laid aside which i am not displeased at because it would have broken our intercourse very much
test0586,here are some verses of calydees tell me how you like them
test0587,i told you in my last that my sufficed journey was laid aside and that into kent hasting
test0588,if i drown by the way this will be my last letter and like a will i bequeath all my kindness to you in it with a charge never to bestow it all upon another mistress lest my ghost rise again and haunt you
test0589,indeed i like him extremely and he is commended to me by people who know him very well and are able to judge for a most excellent servant and faithful as possible
test0590,because you find fault with my other letters this is like being shorter than they i did not intend it so though i can show you
test0591,i do not find it though i am told i was so extremely when i believed you loved me
test0592,but i am called upon
test0593,directed for your master
test0594,i see you can chide when you please and with authority but i deserve it i confess and all i can say for myself is that my fault proceeded from a very good principle in me
test0595,we dare not let our tongues lie more on one side of our mouths than the other for fear of overturning it
test0596,you are satisfied i hope if that i escaped drowning
test0597,but i am troubled much you should make so ill a journey to so little purpose indeed i read by the first post after my arrival here and cannot imagine how you came to miss of my letters
test0598,how welcome you will be but alas
test0599,for my life i cannot beat into their heads a passion that must be subject to no decay an even perfect kindness that must last perpetually without the least interruption
test0600,they laughed to hear me say that one unkind word would destroy all the satisfaction of my life and that i should expect our kindness should increase every day if it were possible but never less
test0601,we go abroad all day and play all night and say our prayers when we have time
test0602,well in sober earnestness now i would not live till a twelve months to gain all that the king has lost unless it were to give it him again
test0603,will you be so good natured
test0604,he has one son and it is the finest boy that ever you saw and has a noble spirit but yet stands in that awe of his father that one word from him is as much as twenty whippings
test0605,you must give me leave to entertain you with discourses of the family for i can tell you nothing else from hence
test0606,not to know when you would come home i can assure you nor for any other occasion of my own but with a cousin of mine that had long designed to make herself at home with him and did not miss of her aim
test0607,in my life i never heard so ridiculous a discourse as he made us and no old woman who passes for a witch could have been more puzzled to seek what to say to reasonable people than he was
test0608,ever since this adventure i have had so great a belief in all things with this nature that i could not forbear laying a pees cord with nine pees under my door yesterday and was informed by it that my husband's name should be thomas how do you like that
test0609,she pulled her hair down turned her skirt back put her feet on the fender and took patty into her lap all of which arrangements signified that something very important had got to be thought over and settled
test0610,the more proposals the more credit
test0611,i've tried it and liked it and maybe this is the consequence of that night's fun
test0612,just suppose it is true that he does ask me and i say yes
test0613,what a spiteful thing i am
test0614,i could do so much for all at home how i should enjoy that
test0615,let me see how can i begin
test0616,he has known her all her life and has a good influence over her
test0617,now as polly was by no means a perfect creature i am free to confess that the old temptation assailed her more than once that week for when the first excitement of the dashing reform had subsided she missed the pleasant little interviews that used to put a certain flavor of romance into her dull working days
test0618,i don't think it was his wealth accomplishments or position that most attracted poly though these doubtless possessed a greater influence than she suspected
test0619,it was that indescribable something which women are quick to see and feel in men who have been blessed with wise and good mothers
test0620,this had a special charm to polly for she soon found that this side of her character was not shown to everyone
test0621,lately this had changed especially towards polly and it flattered her more than she would confess even to herself
test0622,at first she tried to think she could but unfortunately hearts are so contrary that they won't be obedient to reason will or even credibility
test0623,polly felt a very cordial friendship for mister sydney but not one particle of the love which is the only coin in which love can be truly paid
test0624,this finished polly's in decision and after that night she never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant temptation which came in a guy's particularly attractive to a young girl with the spires of the old ivy in her composition
test0625,when saturday came polly started as usual for a visit to backy and west but could not resist stopping at the shores to leave a little parcel for fan though it was calling time
test0626,a foolish little speech to make to a dark but you see polly was only a tender hearted girl trying to do her duty
test0627,take hold of master charles' hand miss mame and walk pretty like willie and flazzy said the maid
test0628,at a street corner a black eyed school boy was parting from a rosy faced school girl whose music role he was reluctantly surrendering
test0629,how he got there was never very clear to polly but there he was flushed and a little out of breath but looking so glad to see her till she had not the heart to be stiff and cool as she had fully intended to be when they met
test0630,she really couldn't help it it was so pleasant to see him again just when she was feeling so lonely
test0631,that is the way i get to the rass answered polly
test0632,she did not mean to tell but his fondness was so agreeable she forgot herself
test0633,but i know her better and i assure you that she does improve she tries to ment her thoughts though she won't own it and will surprise you some day by the amount of heart and sense and goodness she has got
test0634,thank you no
test0635,how lovely the park looks she said in great confusion
test0636,as the art for young men laying a trap into which polly immediately fell
test0637,he was quicker to take a hint than she had expected and being both proud and generous was off to settle the matter at once for polly's sake as well as his own
test0638,so when she made her last proud remark he said quietly watching her face keenly all the while i thought so well i'm going out of town on business for several weeks so you can enjoy your little bit of country without being annoyed by me annoyed
test0639,she thought she had a good deal of the coquettish in her and i have no doubt that with time and training she would have become a very dangerous little person but now she was far to transparent and straight forward by nature even to tell a wild like levity
test0640,he was gone before she could do anything but look up at him with a remorseful face and she walked on feeling that the first and perhaps the only lover she would ever have had read his answer and accepted it in silence
test0641,polly did not return to her favourite walk till she learned from minny that uncle had really left town and then she found that his friendly company and conversation was what had made the way so pleasant after all
test0642,working two and four as usual what's the news with you
test0643,perhaps shielded him
test0644,utterly done with and laid upon the shelf
test0645,minnie said the other day she wished she was a pigeon so she could paddle in the puddles and not fuss about readers
test0646,now don't be afraid polly just tell me like a deer has he not proposed
test0647,don't you think he means to
test0648,truly julie fan
test0649,i don't mean to be prying but i really thought he did
test0650,well i always meant to try if i got a chance and i have
test0651,i just gave him a hint and he took it
test0652,he meant to go away before that so don't think his heart is broken or mind what said stedman say
test0653,he understood and being a gentleman made no fuss
test0654,but polly it would have been a great thing for you
test0655,i'm odd you know i prefer to be an independent spinster and teach music all my days
test0656,never mind what the business was it suffices to say that it was a good beginning for a young man like tom who having been born and bred in the most conservative class of the most conceded city in new england needed just the healthy hearty social influences of the west to widen his views and make a man of him
test0657,fortunately every one was so busy with the necessary preparations that there was no time for romans of any sort and the four young people worked together so soberly and sensibly as if all sorts of emotions were not bottled up in their respective hearts
test0658,pity that the end must come so soon but the hour did its work and went its way leaving a clearer atmosphere behind but the young folks did not see it then for their eyes were dim because of the parting step must be
test0659,if it had not been for two things i fear she never would have stood a summer in town but siddon often called to her vacation came and the voluminous correspondence with polly beguiled the long days
test0660,tom wrote once a week to his mother but the letters were short and not very satisfactory for men never do tell the interesting little things that women best like to hear
test0661,"now i'm only tired had a good idea to do lately and the weather makes me just a traveler,"
test0662,forgive me but i can't help saying it for there and i want to be as true to you as you were to me if i can
test0663,i tried not to deceive myself but it seems as if there was a chance of happiness for me
test0664,"thank heaven for that,"
test0665,cowardly with the hardest satisfaction in her voice
test0666,poor polly was so taken by surprise that she had no word to say
test0667,none when needed she held her face answered for her as well as the impulse which made her hide her head in the sofa couching like a foolish ostrich when the hounds are after it
test0668,once or twice but sort of jokingly and i thought it was only a little fluttering
test0669,it was so stupid of me not to guess before.
test0670,it was so tender and earnest and defiant that fanny forgot the defense of her own lover in admiration of polly's loyalty to her for this faithful all absorbing love was a new revelation to fanny who was used to hearing her friend's boast of two or three lovers a year and calculate their respective values with almost as much coolness as the young man discussed the fortunes of the girls they wished for but could not afford to marry
test0671,i hope maria baley's only thinks her she added softly for i could not bear to have him disappointed again.
test0672,said fanny turning hopeful all at once.
test0673,"suppose i say a word to tun just cry after his heart and a journal away, you know and give him a chance to tell me if there's anything to tell."
test0674,"bear it, people always do bear things somehow, and said polly, looking as if a sentence had been passed upon her."
test0675,it was a very different window from the last above both the girls.
test0676,if any wanted to show him what she could do towards making a pleasant home she certainly succeeded by than she suspected for despite of many failures and discouragements behind the scenes the little house became a most attractive place to mister sydney at least for he was more the house friend than ever and seemed determined to prove that change of fortune made no difference to him
test0677,she kept much at home when the day's work was done finding it pleasant to sit dreaming of a book or soon alone than to exert herself even to go to the shores
test0678,polly was not at all like herself that window and those nearest to her saw and wandered it most
test0679,for net was so absorbed in business that he ignored the whole baily question and left them in other darkness.
test0680,"then he came walking in upon her one day, looking as if she poor told tales of such great joy that she hardly knew how to tell them"
test0681,but if work baskets were gifted with powers of speech they could tell stories more true and tender than any we read.
test0682,she had even been in society before the revolution
test0683,it was her pleasure and vanity to drag in these names on every pretext
test0684,every year she solemnly renewed her vows and at the moment of taking the oath she said to the priest monseigneur saint francois gave it to monseigneur saint julien monseigneur saint julien gave it to monseigneur saint eustace monseigneur saint eustace gave it to monseigneur saint eustace etc etc
test0685,and the school girls would begin to laugh not in their sleeves but under their veils charming little stifled laughs which made the vocal mothers frown
test0686,it was a century which spoke through her but it was the eighteenth century
test0687,the rule of fonteville did not forbid this
test0688,she would not show the object to anyone
test0689,thus it furnished a subject of comment for all those who were on occupied or bored in the convent
test0690,some unique chaplet some authentic relic
test0691,they lost themselves in conjectures
test0692,when the poor old woman died they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting perhaps and opened it
test0693,he is resisting fluttering his tiny wings and still making an effort to fly but the dancer is laughing with a satanic air
test0694,moral love conquered by the colick
test0695,the priors returned and seated herself once more on her chair
test0696,we will present a stenographic report of the dialogue which then ensued to the best of our ability
test0697,father forwent
test0698,reverend mother do you know the chapel
test0699,and you have been in the choir and pursuing of your duties two or three times
test0700,there is a stone to be raised heavy
test0701,the slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar
test0702,the slab which closes the vault yes
test0703,it would be a good thing to have two men for it
test0704,a woman is never a man
test0705,because dom marbala gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of saint marcellus while marcellus horseman only gives three hundred and sixty seven i do not despise marcellus horseman neither do i
test0706,marriage consists in working according to one's strength a cloister is not a dockyard
test0707,and a woman is not a man but my brother is the strong one though
test0708,and can you get a leaver
test0709,there is a ring in this stone
test0710,i will put the lever through it
test0711,that is good reverend mother i will open the vault
test0712,will that be all no
test0713,give me your orders very reverent mother
test0714,for that we have confidence in you
test0715,i am here to do anything you wish
test0716,and to hold your peace about everything yes reverend mother
test0717,when the vault is open i will close it again
test0718,but before that what reverend mother
test0719,father forbear reverend mother
test0720,you know that a mother died this morning
test0721,no did you not hear the bell
test0722,nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden really
test0723,and then the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning
test0724,it was mother's crucifixion
test0725,three years ago madame de boulainvilliers a jansenist turned orthodox merely from having seen madame de boulainvilliers a jansenist turned orthodox merely from having seen madame de boulainvilliers a jansenist turned orthodox merely from having seen madame de boulainvilliers a jansenist turned orthodox merely from having seen madame de boulainvilliers a jansenist turned orthodox merely from having seen madame de boulainvilliers a jansenist turned orthodox merely from having seen madame de boulainvilliers a jansenist turned orthodox merely from having seen madame de boulainvilliers a jansenist turned orthodox merely from having seen madame de boulainvilliers a jansenist turned orthodox merely from having seen madame de boulainvilliers a jansenist turned orthodox merely from having seen madame de boulainv
test0726,the mothers have taken her to the dormitory which opens on the church i know
test0727,a fine sight it would be to see a man enter the bedroom more often
test0728,hey more often
test0729,what do you say
test0730,i say more often more often than what
test0731,reverend mother i did not say more often than what i said more often
test0732,but i did not say it more often
test0733,at that moment nine o'clock struck
test0734,at nine o'clock in the morning and at all hours praised and adored to be the most holy sacrament of the altar said the priest
test0735,it cut more often short
test0736,faulkner mopped his forehead
test0737,in her lifetime mother crucifixion made convents after her death she will
test0738,forthright the community has been blessed in mother's resurrection
test0739,she retained her consciousness to the very last moment
test0740,she gave them her last commands
test0741,if you had a little more faith and if you could have been in her self she would have cured her leg merely by touching it she smiled
test0742,there was something of paradise in that death
test0743,flusser thought that it was an oarsman which she was finishing
test0744,forsalot held his piece she went on
test0745,i have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in our lord who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life and who bear wonderful fruit
test0746,fortunately the prius completely absorbed in her own thoughts did not hear it
test0747,she continued further prevent
test0748,yes reverend mother
test0749,saint trentine bishop of port where the mouth of the tiber empties into the sea requested that on his tomb might be engraved the sign which was placed on the graves of parasites in the hope that passers by would spit on his tomb this was done
test0750,the dead must be obeyed so be it
test0751,for that matter no reverend
test0752,forsaken mother's crucifixion will be intruded in the coffin in which she has slept for the last twenty years that is just
test0753,it is a continuation of her slumber
test0754,so i shall have to nail up that coffin yes
test0755,i am at the orders of the very reverent community
test0756,the four mother presiders will assist you
test0757,no in lowering the coffin
test0758,where in to the old
test0759,foulshank started the vault under the altar
test0760,under the altar but
test0761,you will have an iron bar yes but
test0762,you will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring but
test0763,the dead must be obeyed to be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel not to go to profane earth to remain there in death when she prayed while living such was the last wish of mother's resurrection
test0764,she asked it of us that is to say commanded us
test0765,but it is forbidden
test0766,oh i am a stone in your walls
test0767,think father forwen if she were to work miracles here
test0768,what a glory of god for the community and miracles issue from tombs
test0769,but reverend mother is the agent of the sanitary commission
test0770,but the commissary of police
test0771,shonodamar one of the seven german kings who entered among the gauls under the empire of constantine exactly recognized the right of nobles to be buried in religion that is to say beneath the altar
test0772,the world is nothing in the presence of the cross
test0773,martin the eleventh general of the carthaginians gave to his order this device stactyrum dumvolutum orbis
test0774,the piranha who is usually subjected to the barrier of silence and whose reservoir was over full rose and exclaimed with the loquacity of a dam that has broken away
test0775,i have on my right benno and on my left bernard who was bernard
test0776,the first abbot of clairvaux
test0777,his order has produced forty popes hundred cardinals fifty patriarchs seventeen hundred archbishops four thousand twelve emperors twelve emperors forty six kings forty six queens three thousand six hundred bishops four emperors twelve emperors forty six kings forty six queens three thousand six hundred canonized saints and has been in existence for fourteen hundred years
test0778,on one side saint bernard on the other the agent of the sanitary department
test0779,god subordinated to the commissary of police such as the age silence vivot
test0780,no one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulchre
test0781,only fanatics and those in error deny it
test0782,we live in times of terrible confusion
test0783,we are ignorant and imbecile
test0784,and then religion is attacked why
test0785,because there have been bad priests because sagatar bishop of gape was a brother of solon bishop of ember and because both of them followed maol
test0786,they persecuted the saints
test0787,they shut their eyes to the truth darkness is the rule
test0788,the most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind
test0789,oh how wicked they are
test0790,by order of the king signifies to day by order of the revolution
test0791,one no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead a holy death is prohibited
test0792,guthier bishop of chalons held his own in this matter against otho of burgundy
test0793,the priest took breath then turned to the vault
test0794,you will close the coffin the sisters will carry it to the chapel
test0795,the office for the dead will then be set
test0796,but she will hear she will not listen
test0797,besides what the cloister knows the world learns not
test0798,a pause and suit
test0799,you will remove your bell.
test0800,has the doctor for the dead paid his visit
test0801,he will pay at four o'clock today
test0802,the peel which orders the doctor for the dead to be summoned has already been wrong
test0803,but you do not understand any of the peels
test0804,that is well father prevent
test0805,where will you obtain it
test0806,i have my heap of old gold at the bottom of the garden
test0807,reverend mother what
test0808,if you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort my brother is the strong man for you a perfect turk
test0809,you will do it as quickly as possible
test0810,i cannot work very fast i am firm that is why i require an assistant i limp
test0811,everything must have been completed a good quarter of an hour before that
test0812,i will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community these are my orders i am to nail up the coffin
test0813,at eleven o'clock exactly i am to be in the chapel
test0814,mother ascension will be there two men will be better
test0815,however never mind i shall have my lover
test0816,after which there will be no trace of anything
test0817,the government will have no suspicion
test0818,the empty coffin remains this produced a pause
test0819,what is to be done with that coffin beforevent
test0820,it will be given to the earth empty
test0821,ah leida exclaimed forlornly
test0822,the veil stuck fast in his throat
test0823,he made haste to improvise and expedite to make her forget the oath
test0824,i will put earth in the coffin reverend mother that will produce the effect of a corpse
test0825,i will make that my special business
test0826,"general observations on preserves, confectionery ices and dessert dishes"
test0827,the expense of preserving them with sugar is a serious objection for except a sugar is used in considerable qualities this success is very uncertain
test0828,fruit gathered in wet or foggy weather shall soon be milled and be of no service for preserves
test0829,but to distinguish these properly requires very great attention and considerable experience
test0830,if you dip the finger into the serf and apply to the thumb the tenacity of the serf will on separating the finger and thumb afford a thread which shortly breaks this is the little thread
test0831,let it boil up again and then take it off and remove carefully the scum that has risen
test0832,it is considered to be sufficiently boiled when some taken up in a spoon pours out like oil
test0833,before sugar was in use honey was employed to preserve many vegetable productions though this substance is now given away by the juice of the sugar cane
test0834,fourteen ninety nine
test0835,boil them up three days successively skimming each time and they will then be finished and in a state fit to be put into pots for use
test0836,the reason why the fruit is emptying out of the preserving pan into an earthen pan is that the acid of the fruit acts upon the copper of which the preserving pans are usually made
test0837,from this example the process of preserving fruits by syrup would be easily comprehended
test0838,they should be dried in the stove or on a seive and turned every six or eight hours fresh powdered sulfur being sifted over them every time they are turned
test0839,and in this way it is also that orange and lemon chips are preserved
test0840,marmalades jams and fruit preserves of the same nature and are now in very general quest
test0841,marigolds and jams differ a little from each other their preserves of half liquid consistency made by boiling the pulp of fruits and sometimes part of the rinds with sugar
test0842,that they may keep it as necessary not to be sparing of sugar fifteen o three
test0843,in all the operations for preserving making when the preserving pan is used it should not be placed on the fire but on a trivet unless the jam is made on a hot pan when this is not necessary
test0844,confectionery fifteen o eight
test0845,in speaking of confectionery should be reminded that all the various preparations above named come strictly speaking under that head from the various fruits flowers herbs and roots and juices which when boiled with sugar were formally employed in pharmacy as well as for sweetmeats from the latin word confectioner to make up but the term confectioner embraces a very large class indeed of sweet food many kinds of which should not be attempted in the ordinary cuisine
test0846,the thousand and one ornamental dishes that adorned the tables of the wealthy should be purchased from the confectioner they can not be made at home
test0847,however as late as the reign of our two last georgians fabulous sums were often expended upon fanciful desserts
test0848,the shape of the dishes varies at different periods the prevailing fashion at present being oval and circular dishes on stems
test0849,isis
test0850,at desserts or at some evening parties ice is scarcely to be dispensed with
test0851,the spatter is generally made of copper kept bright and clean
test0852,they should be taken immediately after the repast or some hours after because the taking of these substances during the process of digestion is apt to provoke indigestion
test0853,there was once upon a time a widow who had a son and a daughter by his first wife
test0854,from the very day that the new wife came into the house there was no peace for the men's children and no corner to be found where they could get any rest so the boy thought that the best thing he could do was to go out into the world and try to earn his own bread
test0855,but his sister who was still at home fared worse and worse
test0856,kiss me girl said the head
test0857,when the king entered and saw him he stood still as if he were in fettlers and could not stir from the spot for the picture seemed to him so beautiful
test0858,the youth promised to make all the haste he could and set forth from the king's palace
test0859,at last they came inside of land
test0860,well if my brother says so i must do it said the man's daughter and she flung her cloak into the sea
test0861,what is my brother saying asked his sister again
test0862,on the first thursday night after this a beautiful maiden came into the kitchen of the palace and begged the kitchen maid who slept there to lend her a brush
test0863,she begged very pritily and got it and then she brushed her hair and the gold dropped from it
test0864,out on the ugly bushy bride sleeping so soft on the young king's side on sand and stones my bed i make and my brother sleeps with a cold snake unpitying and unwept
test0865,i shall come twice more and then never again said she
test0866,this time also as before she borrowed a brush and brushed her hair with it and the gold dropped down as she did it and again she sent the dog out three times and when day dawned she departed but as she was going she said as she had said before i shall come once more and then never again
test0867,no one can tell how delighted the king got to get rid of that hateful bushy bride and get a queen who was bright and beautiful as it itself
test0868,wilt thou serve me and watch my seven fawns as the king
test0869,the youth thought that it was very easy work to watch the foles and he could do it well enough
test0870,hast thou watch'd faithfully and well the whole day long said the king when the light came into his presence in the evening
test0871,yes that i have said the youth
test0872,he had gone out once to seek a place he said but never would he do such a thing again
test0873,then the king promised him the same punishment and the same reward that he had promised his brother
test0874,when he had run after the fools for a long long time and was hot and tired he passed by a cleft in the rock where an old woman was sitting spinning with the distaff and she called to him
test0875,come hither hither my handsome son and let me comb your hair
test0876,the youth liked the thought of this let the hags run where they chose and seated himself in the cleft of the rock by the side of the old hag
test0877,so there he sat with his head on her lap taking his ease the live long day
test0878,on the third day siddhartha wanted to set out
test0879,the two brothers laughed at him and his father and mother begged him not to go but all to no purpose and cinderlads went out on his way
test0880,i'm walking about in search of a place at cinderella
test0881,i would much rather have the princess at cinderella
test0882,and thus they journeyed onward a long long way
test0883,when they had gone on for a long long way the full again asked dost thou see anything now
test0884,yes now i see something that is white said cinderella
test0885,it looks like a chunk of a great thick birch tree.
test0886,cinderella tried but could not do it so he had to take a draught from the pitcher and then one more and after that still another and then he was able to wheel the sword with perfect ease
test0887,for we are brothers of the princess whom thou art to have when thou canst tell the king what we eat and drink but there is a mighty thief who has cast a spell over us
test0888,when they had traveled a long long way the full said does not see anything
test0889,and now inquiringly she saw nothing now
test0890,now said the fellow does he not see anything now
test0891,that is a river said the full and we have to cross it
test0892,i've done my best replied cinderella
test0893,once upon a time there was a king in the north who had won many wars but now he was old
test0894,the old king went out and fought bravely but at last his sword broke and he was wounded and his men fled
test0895,but in the night when the battle was over his young wife came out and searched for him among the slain and at last she found him and asked whether he might be healed
test0896,so said the queen how do you know in the dark of night whether the hours are wearing to the morning and she said
test0897,then the old man said drive all the horses into the river and choose the one that swims across
test0898,he has no bigger other dragons said the tutor and if you were as brave as your father you would not fear him
test0899,then the person who had killed otter went down and caught the dragon who owned all the treasure and took it from him
test0900,only one ring was left which the dwarf wore and even that was taken from him
test0901,reigen tried it with a blow on a lump of iron and the sword broke
test0902,then sigurd went to his mother and asked for the broken pieces of his father's blade and gave them to reikin
test0903,so sigurd said that sword would do
test0904,then he saw the track which the dragon had made when he went to a cliff to drink and the track was as if a great river had rolled along and left a deep valley
test0905,but sigurd waited until half of him had fallen over the pit and then he thrust the sword gram right into his very heart
test0906,sigurd said i would touch none of it if by losing it i should never die
test0907,but all men die and no brave man lets death frighten him from his desire
test0908,dye alva fanner and then fanner died
test0909,then sigurd rode back and met regin and regin asked him to roast fafnir's heart and let him taste of it
test0910,sister put the heart of the faun on a steak and roasted it
test0911,there sigurd roasting fafnir's heart for another when he should taste of it himself and learn all wisdom
test0912,"that let him do it then, and then over hinfield to the place where burnhill sleeps."
test0913,there she must sleep till she comes for her waking rise up and ride for now sure she will swear the vow fearful of breaking
test0914,then he took the helmet off the head of the sleeper and behold she was a most beautiful lady
test0915,then ridgeway went away and he came to the house of a king who had a fair daughter
test0916,lindenhill's father told gunner that she would marry none but him who would ride the flame in front of her enchanted tower and there they rode and gunner said his horse at the flame but he would not face it
test0917,for one day when brinnhill and gundren were bathing brinnhill waited farther out into the river and she said that did that to show she was gundren superior
test0918,for her husband she said had run through the flame when no other man dared face it
test0919,not long to wait he said till the bitter sword stands fast in my heart and now will not live long when i am dead
test0920,lobsters and lobsters
test0921,when is a lobster not a lobster when it is a crayfish
test0922,this question and answer might well go into the primary of information for those who come to san francisco from the east for what is called a lobster in san francisco is not a lobster at all but a crayfish
test0923,the pacific crocodile however serves every purpose and while many contend that its meat is not so delicate in flavour as that of its eastern cousin the californian will strenuously insist that it is better but of course something must always be allowed for the patriotism of the californian
test0924,a book could be written about this restaurant and then all would not be told for all its secrets can never be known
test0925,it was here that most magnificent dinners were arranged it was here that extraordinary dishes were concocted by chefs with world wide fame it was here that lobster alen newbury reached its highest perfection and this is the recipe that was followed when it was prepared in the domoniko
test0926,lobster ellie newburg

test0930,king of shellfish
test0931,one has to come to san francisco to partake of the king of shellfish the mammoth pacific crab.
test0932,i say come to san francisco advisedly for while the crab is found all along the coast it is prepared no where so deliciously as in san francisco
test0933,gobies passed with the fire and the little restaurant bearing his name and in charge of his widow in united square avenue has not attained the fame of the old place
test0934,it is possible that she knows the secret of a preparing crab as it was prepared in the gobies of before the fire but his pretext did not descend to her
test0935,gooby's crab stew
test0936,take the meat of one large crab scraping out all the fat from the shell
test0937,sole the crab meat in the sherry two hours before cooking
test0938,chop fine the onion sweet pepper and tomato with the rosemary
test0939,heep this in a stew pan and when simmering add the cherry and crab meat and let all cook together with the slow fire for eight minutes
test0940,serve in a chafing dish with toasted crackers or thin slices of toasted bread
test0941,lambert in miniature
test0942,so far it has been mostly for garnishing of other dishes and it is only recently that the holfrau has been making a specialty of them
test0943,all the better class restaurants however will serve them if you order them
test0944,this is the recipe for eight people and it is well worth trying if you are giving a dinner of importance
test0945,biscuit of crawfish
test0946,take thirty crocodiles from which removed the gut containing the gall in the following manner take firm hold of the crocodile with the left hand so as to avoid being bitten by its claw with the thumb and forefinger of the right hand pinch the extreme end of the central fin of the tail and with a sudden jerk the gut will be withdrawn
test0947,mints were cut into small dices a carrot and an onion one head of celery and a few parsley roots and to these at a bay leaf of sprig of time a little minnet pepper and two ounces of butter
test0948,put these ingredients into a stewpan and fry them ten minutes then throw in the crawfish and pour on them half a bottle of french white wine
test0949,allow this to boil and then add a quart of strong consomme and let all continue boiling for half an hour
test0950,pick out the crawfish and strain the broth through a napkin by pressure into a basin in order to extract all the essence from the vegetables
test0951,pick the shells off twenty of the crawfish tails trim them neatly and set them aside until wanted
test0952,reserve some of the spawn also half of the body shells with which to make the crawfish butter to finish the soup
test0953,this butter is made as follows place the shells in a baking sheet in the oven to dry let the shells cool and then pound them in a mortar with a little lobster coral and four ounces of fresh butter thoroughly bruising the whole together so as to make a fine paste
test0954,i swear answered sumchon
test0955,i say so continued donkey hoare because i hate taking away anyone's good name
test0956,i say replied sancho that i swear to hold my mouth about it till the end of your worship's days and congratulate me i may be able to let it out tomorrow
test0957,though your worship was not so badly off having in your arms an incomparable beauty you spoke but what did i have except the heaviest wax that i think i had in all my life
test0958,unlucky me and the mother who bore me
test0959,didn't i say worst luck to my lies said chanco
test0960,it cannot be the more answered donkey hoody for those under enchantment do not let themselves be seen by anyone
test0961,if they do not let themselves be seen they let themselves be felt said candace if not let my shoulders speak to the point
test0962,mine could speak too said donkey hoed but that is not a suspicious reason for believing what that we see is the enchanted moor
test0963,the officer turned in and said well how goes a good man
test0964,sandra got up with enough pain in her bones and went after the innkeeper in the dark in meeting the officer who was looking to see what had become of his enemy he said to him senor whoever you are do us to favour and kindness to give us a little rosemary oil salt and wine for it is wanting her to give us one of our best men's errant on earth who lies on yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted more that is in this inn
test0965,to be brief he took the materials of which he made a compound mixing them all and boiling them a good while until it seemed to him they had come to perfection
test0966,sancha panza who also regarded the amendment of his master as miraculous begged him to give him what was left of the pigskin which was no small quantity
test0967,donkey hood it consented and he taking it with both hands in good faith and with a better will gulped it down and drained very little less than his master
test0968,if your worship knew that returned sacho well be tied me in all my kindness why did you let me taste it
test0969,search your memory and if you find anything of this kind you need only tell me of it and i promise you by the order of night hood which i have received to procure you satisfaction and repair to the utmost of your desire
test0970,then this is not an in said donkey hoey
test0971,and a very respectful one said the inkeeper
test0972,the cries of the poor blighted wretch were so loud that they reached the ears of his master who halting to listen attentively was persuaded that some new adventure was coming until he clearly perceived that it was his squaw who uttered them
test0973,he saw him rising and falling in the air with such grace and nimbleness that had his regaled him it is my belief he would have left
test0974,sancho took it and as he was raising it to his mouth he was stopped by the cries of his master exclaiming sancho my son drink not water drink not my son for it will kill you see here i have the blessed balsam and he held up the flask of liquor and with drinking two drops of it will certainly be restored
test0975,the strides of a lame man are like the ogling glances of a one eyed man they do not reach their goal very promptly
test0976,cassette had woken up
test0977,jean valjean had placed her near the fire
test0978,you will wait for me at a lady's house i shall come to fetch you
test0979,everything is arranged and nothing is said said forschwelen
test0980,i have permission to bring you in but before bringing you in you must be got out
test0981,that's where the difficulty lies
test0982,it is easy enough with the child you will carry her out
test0983,and she will hold her tongue i answer for that
test0984,fouché grumbled more to himself than to jean valjean
test0985,you understand father madeline the government will notice it
test0986,joanne starr saw him straight in the eye and thought that he was ravishing
test0987,fulshon went on
test0988,it is tomorrow the time to bring you in the prior expects you
test0989,then he explained to jean vangeon that this was his compensation for a service which he fouchault was to render to the community
test0990,that the nun who had died that morning had required to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed and entombed in the vault under the altar of the chapel
test0991,that the priestess and the vocal mothers intended to fulfill the wish of the deceased
test0992,that he fushlivan was to nail up the coffin in the cell raised the stone in the chapel and blow the corpse into the vault
test0993,and then that there was another the empty coffin
test0994,what is that empty coffin
test0995,asked jan van gogh floch replied
test0996,what coffin what administration
test0997,folleville who was seated sprang up as though a bomb had burst under his chair you
test0998,you know flanchon what you have said mother's crucifixion is dead
test0999,and i add and father madeline is buried ar
test1000,you are not like other men father madeline
test1001,this offers the means give me some information in the first place
test1002,how long is the coffin six feet
test1003,it is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening on the garden which is closed on the outside by a shutter and two doors one leads into the convent the other into the church what church
test1004,the church in the street the church which anyone can enter
test1005,have you the keys to those two doors
test1006,no i have the key to the door which communicates with the convent the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church
test1007,only to allow the undertakers to men to enter they come to get the coffin
test1008,who nails up the coffin but i do
test1009,who spreads the poll over it
test1010,not another man except the police doctor can enter the dead room that is even written on the wall
test1011,could you hide me in that room tonight when everyone is asleep
test1012,about three o'clock in the afternoon
test1013,i shall be hungry but i will bring you something
test1014,you can come and nail me up in the coffin at two o'clock
test1015,floshley recoiled and cracked his finger joints but that is impossible
test1016,bah impossible to take a hammer and drive some nails in a plank
test1017,jean valjean had been in worse states than this
test1018,any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape
test1019,what does not a man undertake for the sake of a cure
test1020,to have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bale of goods to live for a long time in a box to find air where there is none to economize his breath for hours to know how to stifle without dying this was one of jean gans gloomy talents
test1021,you surely must have a gimlet you will make a few holes here and there around my mouth and you will nail the top plank loosely good and what if you should happen to cough or to sneeze
test1022,a man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze
test1023,who is there who has not said to a cat do come in
test1024,the overprovident cats as they are and because they are cats sometimes incur more danger than the audacious
test1025,but jean valjean's coolness prevailed over him in spite of himself he grumbled
test1026,if you are sure of coming out of the coffin right i am sure of getting you out of the grave
test1027,an old fellow of the old school the grave digger puts the corpses in the grave and i put the grave digger in my pocket
test1028,i shall follow that is my business
test1029,the herdsman holds the undertaker not a rope around your coffin and lower you down
test1030,the priests as the prayers makes the sign of the cross sprinkles the holy water and takes his departure
test1031,one of two things will happen he will either be sober or he will not be sober
test1032,that is settled father fushlevin all will go well
test1033,on the following day as the sun was declining the very rare passes by on the boulevard du menin pulled off their hats to an old fashioned herse ornamented with skulls crossbones and tears
test1034,this herse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross like a huge corpse with drooping arms
test1035,a morning coach in which could be seen a priest in his surplus and a quire boy in his red cap followed
test1036,behind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer who limped along
test1037,the grave diggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at night in winter in this cemetery they were subjected to a special discipline
test1038,these gates therefore swung inextricably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the invalid
test1039,dampness was invading it the flowers were desiccating it
test1040,the bourguet did not care much about being buried in the vogueja it hinted at poverty pahlachas if you please
test1041,to be buried in percheles is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany it is recognized as elegant
test1042,the interment of mother's crucifixion in the vault under the altar the exit of coquette the introduction of jean valjean into the dungeon all had been executed without difficulty and there had been no hitch let us remark in passing that the burial of mother's crucifixion under the altar of the convent is a perfectly venial offense in our sight
test1043,it is one of the forces which resemble a duty
test1044,the nuns had committed it not only without difficulty but even with the applause of their own conscience
test1045,in the cloister what is called the government is only an intermedling with authority an interference which is always questionable
test1046,make as many laws as you please men but keep them for yourself
test1047,a prince is nothing in the presence of a principle
test1048,furloshin limped along behind the herds in a very contented frame of mind
test1049,jean valjean's composition was one of those powerful tranquillities which are contagious
test1050,what remained to be done was a mere nothing
test1051,he played with father misthen
test1052,he did what he liked with him he made him dance according to his whim
test1053,the permission for interment must be exhibited
test1054,he was a sort of laboring man who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a matock under his arm
test1055,the man replied the grave digger
test1056,the grave digger yes
test1057,you i
test1058,farewell missus tienne the grave digger he was
test1059,fouché had expected anything but this that a grave digger could die
test1060,it is true nevertheless that grave diggers do die themselves
test1061,he had hardly the strength to stoma
test1062,but he persisted feebly father mister is the grave digger
test1063,do you know who little father lunair is he a jug of red wine
test1064,but you are a jolly fellow too
test1065,are you not comrade we'll go and have a drink together presently
test1066,the man replied
test1067,he limped more out of anxiety than from infirmity
test1068,the grave digger walked on in front of him
test1069,fochlaon passed the unexpected cleavie once more in review
test1070,fulvian who was illiterate but very sharp understood that he had to deal with a formidable species of man with a fine talker he muttered
test1071,but so father stein is dead
test1072,the man replied completely
test1073,the good god consulted his notebook which shows when the time is up it was father mestin's turn father mestin died
test1074,stamford foyle it is made
test1075,you are a peasant i am a persian
test1076,forsaken of thought i am lost
test1077,they were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small alley leading to the nun's corner
test1078,and he added with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well
test1079,fortunately the soil which was light and wet with the winter rains clotted the wheels and retired its speed
test1080,my father was a porter at the princeton town hall
test1081,but he had reverses he had losses on change i was obliged to renounce the profession of author but i am still a public writer
test1082,so you are not a grave digger then
test1083,return volshevol clutching at this branch feeble as it was
test1084,here a remark becomes necessary
test1085,a furlan whatever his anger offered a drink but he did not explain himself on one point who was to pay
test1086,the grave digger went on with a superior smile
test1087,one must eat
test1088,the duke comes every morning they will tell him when he comes that i am asleep and perhaps he will wait until i awake
test1089,yes but if i should already ask for something what
test1090,well do it for me for i swear to you that i don't love you as the others have loved you
test1091,there are bolts in the door rich
test1092,i don't know how it is but it seems to me as if i do
test1093,now go i can't keep my eyes open
test1094,it seemed to me as if this sleeping city belonged to me i searched my memory for the names of those whose happiness i had once envied and i could not recall one without finding myself the happier
test1095,education family feeling the sense of duty the family are strong sentinels but there are no sentinels so vigilant as not to be deceived by a girl of sixteen to whom nature by the voice of the woman she loves gives the first council of love all the more ardent because they seem so pure
test1096,the more girl believes in goodness the more easily will she give way if not to her lover at least to love for being without mistrust she is without force and to win her love is a triumph that can be gained by any young man of five and twenty see how young girls are watched and guarded
test1097,then how surely must they desire the world which is hidden from them how surely must they find it tempting how surely must they listen to the first voice which comes to tell its secrets through their bars and bless the hand which is the first to raise a corner of the mystery veil
test1098,with them the body has worn out the soul the senses have burned up the heart dissipation has blunted the feelings
test1099,they love by profession and not by instincts.
test1100,when a creature who has all her past to reproach herself with is taken all at once by a profound sincere irrepressible love of which she had never felt herself capable when she has confessed her love how absolutely the man who she loves dominates her
test1101,they know not what proof to give
test1102,in order to disturb the laborers in the field was one day devoured by a wolf because those who him had so often deceived no longer believed in his cries for help
test1103,this is the same with these unhappy women when they love seriously
test1104,but when the man who inspires this redeeming love is great enough in soul to receive it without remembering the past when he gives himself up to it when in short he loves as he is loved this man drains at one drought all earthly emotions and after such a love his heart will be closed to every other
test1105,but to return to the first day of my leia's
test1106,when i reached home i was in the state of mad gaiety
test1107,the woman becomes the man's mistress and loves him
test1108,how why
test1109,my whole being was exalted into joy at the memory of the words we had exchanged during that first night
test1110,here are my orders tonight adobevil
test1111,calmed during the third and tranced
test1112,the boxes filled one after another
test1113,only one remains empty the stage box
test1114,at the beginning of the third act i heard the door of the box on which my eyes had been almost constantly fixed open and marguerite appeared
test1115,did she love me enough to believe that the more beautiful she looked the happier i should be
test1116,what is the matter with you to night said margaret rising and coming to the back of the box and kissing me on the forehead
test1117,you should go to bed she replied with that ironic era which went so well with her delicate and witty face
test1118,where at home
test1119,you still love me can you ask
test1120,because you don't like seeing him
test1121,notwithstanding i was very unhappy all the rest of the evening and went away very sadly after having seen prudence the count and marguerite get into the carriage which was waiting for them at the door
test1122,i have not come to hinder you from leaving paris.
test1123,you are in the way margaret but how
test1124,well you might have had a woman here said prudence and it would hardly have been amusing for her to see two more arrive
test1125,during this remark marquise looked at me attentively
test1126,my dear prudence i answered he does not know what you are saying
test1127,yes but besides not wishing to put you out i wasn't sure that if you came as far as my door you would want to come up and as i could not let you i did not wish to let you go away blaming me for saying no
test1128,because i am watched and the least suspicion might do me the greatest harm
test1129,is that really the only reason
test1130,if there were any other i would tell you for we are not to have any secrets from one another now
test1131,honestly do you care for me a little a great deal
test1132,i fancied for a moment that i might give myself that happiness for six months you would not have it you insisted on knowing the means
test1133,well good heavens the means were easy enough to guess
test1134,i listened and i gazed the marigold with admiration
test1135,when i thought that this marvelous creature whose feet i had once longed to kiss was willing to let me take my place in her thoughts my part in her life and that i was not yet content with what she gave me i asked if man's desire had indeed limits when satisfied as promptly as his mind had been it reached after something further
test1136,truly she continued we poor creatures of chance have fantastic desire and inconceivable loves
test1137,we are not allowed to have hearts under the penalty of being hooted down and of ruining our credit
test1138,we no longer belong to ourselves
test1139,we stand first in their self-esteem last in their esteem
test1140,never do they give you advice which is not lucrative
test1141,it means little enough to them that we should have ten lovers extra as long as they get dresses or a bracelet out of them and that they can drive in our carriage from time to time or come to our box at the theater
test1142,such a man i found in the duke but the duke is old and the old age neither protects nor consols
test1143,i thought i could not accept the life which he offered but what would you have
test1144,what i loved in you was not the man who was but the man who was going to be
test1145,margaret tired out with this long confession threw herself back on the sofa and to stifle a slight cough put up her handkerchief to her lips and from that to her eyes
test1146,margaret do with me as you will i am your slave your dog but in the name of heaven tear up the letter which i wrote to you and do not make me leave you tomorrow it would kill me
test1147,marigolds drew the letter from her bosom and handing it to me with a smile of infinite sweetness said
test1148,here it is i have brought it back
test1149,i tore the letter into fragments and kissed with tears the hand that gave it to me
test1150,look here prudence do you know what he wants said margaret
test1151,he wants you to forgive him
test1152,one has to but he wants more than that what then
test1153,i embraced margaret until she was almost stifled
test1154,almost mister buzzed grind
test1155,this sounded like another story.
test1156,he was curious about that black-headed cousin of all mister basset very curious indeed.
test1157,"any way he would find out,"
test1158,please mister buzzard please tell us the story he bagged
test1159,now all mister buzzard is naturally good natured and accommodating and when peter bagged so hard he just couldn't find it in his heart to refuse
test1160,way back in the days when grandpa buzzard had his little falling out with old king eagle and then flew so high he scorched the feathers off in his head he had a cousin did grandpa buzzard and this cousin was just naturally lazy and no count
test1161,like most no count people he used to make a regular nuisance of himself poking his nose into every body's business and never tending to his own
test1162,wasn't anything going on that this truffling member of the buster family didn't find out about a medal in he could ask more questions than peter rabbit can and anyone that can do that has got to ask a lot
test1163,everybody looked at peter and laughed
test1164,so weian sat on the chimney tops whenever all old jack frost gets to straining down where he has no business
test1165,one day this no count trifling cousin of grandpapa buzzard get cold in his feet
test1166,it was on the little old house a little old tumble down house
test1167,why he just stretched his full head as far down the chimney as he can and listen and listen
test1168,but he don't mind that
test1169,will you all please speak a little louder he hollered down the chimney just like that
test1170,"yes, she surely was plump scared"
test1171,they like to chock that no count chaser to death
test1172,when he got home he tried and tried to brush that suit off but it doesn't get into the skin and it stays there.
test1173,a little sigh of satisfaction went round the circle of listeners
test1174,it was just as good as one of grandfather frogs
test1175,draw reach fill mix give me it without water
test1176,so my friend so whip me off this glass neatly bring me hither some clarit a full weeping to till it over
test1177,a cessation and truths with thirst

test1184,he drinks in vain that doesn't the pleasure of it
test1185,it is enough to break both girds and petroleum
test1186,what difference is there between a bottle and a flask?
test1187,bravely and well pleased upon the words
test1188,"our fathers drank lustily and emptied their cans,"
test1189,well cackled well sung
test1190,let us drink will you send nothing to the river
test1191,i drank no more than the sponge
test1192,i drink like a temple law night
test1193,and i t'ankram sponsors

test1204,sparrows will i not eat unless you barbed them on the tail nor can i drink if i be not fairly spoken to
test1205,oh this was binging soundly
test1206,but this shall banish it utterly
test1207,let us wind our horns by the sound of flagons and bottles and cry aloud that whoever has lost his thirst come not hither to seek it
test1208,the great god made the planets and we make the platters neat
test1209,appetite comes with eating says angustin but the thirst goes away with drinking
test1210,i have a remedy against thirst quite contrary to that which is good against the biting of a man dog
test1211,white wine wine boys
test1212,o lacrima christi it is of the best grape
test1213,i faith pure greek greek oh the fine white wine

test1218,clear off neat supernatural
test1219,although the plague was there in the most part of all the houses they never nevertheless entered everywhere then plundered and carried away all that was within and yet for all this not one of them took any hurt which is a most wonderful case
test1220,i beseech you think upon it
test1221,nevertheless at all ventures they rang the bells add capitolium capitolines
test1222,by the virtue of god why do you not sing paniers farewell vintage is done
test1223,by the belly of saint james what shall we poor devils drink the while
test1224,lord god dmi heptomeon
test1225,let him be carried the prison for troubling the divine service
test1226,wherefore is it that our devotions were instituted to be short in the time of harvest and vintage and long in the advent and the winter
test1227,hark you my masters you that love the wine cop's body follow me for saint anthony burned me as freely as a fagot they get leaves to taste one drop of the liquor that would not now come and fight for relief of the vine
test1228,to others again he unjointed the spindles or knuckles of the neck disfigured their chops gased their faces made their cheeks hang flapping on their chin and so swung and bewailed them that they fell down before him like hay before a mow
test1229,to some with the smart suits on the episcopalian he would make their mid-drift wag then reducing the blow gave them such a home push on the navy that he made their puddings to gush out
test1230,believe that it was the most horrible spectacle that ever one saw
test1231,oh the holy lady naitich said one the good saints oh our lady of secours said another help help
test1232,some died without speaking others spoke without dying some died in speaking others spoke in dying
test1233,can you tell with what instruments they did it
test1234,in the meantime friar john with his formidable baton of the cross got to the breach which the enemies had made and there stood to snatch up those that endeavoured to escape
test1235,it is significant to note in this connection that the new king was an unwavering adherent of the cult of ashura by the adherents of which he was probably strongly supported
test1236,at the beginning of his reign there was much social discontent and suffering
test1237,well may shardur exclaim in the words of the prophet where is the king of arpad
test1238,tiglath-pilesher however crossed the ephraim and moving northward delivered an unexpected attack on an ephraim army in kumpum
test1239,a fierce battle ensued and one of its dramatic incidents was a single combat between the rival kings
test1240,an attempt was made to capture king charles who leapt from his chariot and made hasty escape on horseback hasty pursued in the gathering darkness by an asarian contingent of calvary
test1241,despite the blow dealt against you assyria did not immediately regain possession of north syria
test1242,the shiftless manteau illius either cherishes the hope that shardurus would recover strength and again invade north syria or that he might himself establish an empire in that region
test1243,tiglath-pilneser leisure therefore to march westward again
test1244,for three years he conducted vigorous campaigns in the western land where he meant with vigorous resistance
test1245,arp was captured and manteuil deplored and probably put to death
test1246,once again the hebrews came into contact with this area
test1247,its fall may not have been disconnected with the trend of events in syria during the closing years of the middle empire
test1248,jehoash the grandson of jehoash had achieved successes in conflict with damascus
test1249,six months thereafter he was assassinated by shalum
test1250,this usurper held sway at samaria for only a month
test1251,no resistance was possible on the part of manahem the usurper who was probably ready to welcome the assyrian conqueror so that by arranging an alliance he might secure his own position
test1252,talgha police next operated against the median and other hill tribes in the north east
test1253,he overthrew buildings destroyed orchards and transported to ninava those of their inhabitants he had not put to the ward with all the livestock he could lay hands on
test1254,thus was erutu crippled and humiliated it never regained its form of prestige among the northern states
test1255,in the following year tiglath-pileser returned to syria
test1256,manasseh king of israel had died and was succeeded by his son pecaiah
test1257,judah had taken advantage of the disturbed conditions in israel to assert its independence
test1258,he condemned israel for its idolatry and cried
test1259,for thus say the lord unto the house of israel seek me and thou shalt live have thou offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years oh house of israel
test1260,the remnant of the philistines sojourned
test1261,israel was also dealt with
test1262,he swept through israel like a hurricane
test1263,the felatines and the arabians of the desert were also subdued
test1264,he invaded babylonia
test1265,ukena took refuge in his capital shapia which held out successfully although the surrounding country was ravaged and spoiled
test1266,as i thought that this was due to some fault in the earth i wanted to make these first experiments before i undertook my perseus
test1267,when i saw that this bust came out sharp and clean i said at once to construct a little furnace in the workshop erected for me by the duke after my own plans and design in the house which the duke had given me
test1268,it was an extremely difficult task and i was anxious to observe all the niceties of art which i had learned so as not to lapse into some error
test1269,i in my turn feel the same desire and hope to play my part like them therefore my lord give me the leave to go
test1270,but beware of letting benedictine quit you rather bestow upon him always more than he demands for if he goes into foreign parts his ignorance is so presumptuous that he is just the man to disgrace our most illustrious school
test1271,i asked no further reward for my labors up to the time than the gracious favour of your most illustrious excellence
test1272,then i thanked him and said i had no greater desire than to show those envious people that i had it in me to execute the promised work
test1273,i had better look to my conduct for it had come to his ears that i relied upon his favor to take in first one man and then another
test1274,i begged his most illustrious excellence to name a single person who i had ever taken in
test1275,i said my lord i thank you and beg you to condescend so far as to listen to four words it is true that he let me a pair of old scales two anvils and three little hammers which articles i begged his workman georgio di cortona fifteen days ago to fetch back
test1276,george came for them his health
test1277,i hope to prove on what account that scoundrel tries to bring me into this disgrace
test1278,when he had heard this speech the duke rose up in anger and sent for bernardone who was forced to take flight as far as venice and he and antonio landi with him
test1279,you would better put this to the proof and i will go at once to the barzello
test1280,i am willing to enter into competition with the ancients and feel able to surpass them for since those early days in which i made the medals of pope clément i have learned so much that i can now produce far better pieces of the kind i think i can also outdo the coins i struck for duke galeando which are still held in high esteem in like manner i could make for you large pieces of gold and silver plate as i did so often for that noble monarch king francis of france thanks to the great conveniences he allowed me
test1281,after several months were wasted and pierre neither would either nor put men to work upon the piece he made it give it back
test1282,among artists certain in rage sculptors laughed at me and called me the new sculptor
test1283,now i hope to show them that i am an old sculptor if shall grant me the boon of finishing my perseus for that noble piazza of his most illustrious excellence
test1284,having this excellent resolve in heart i reached my home
test1285,wilder was rather curiously after the ladies had floated away from the scene and he drank his liquor doggedly
test1286,it was his fantasy i suppose to revive certain sentimental relations which had it may be once existed between him and miss lake and he was a person of that combative temperament that magnifies an object in proportion as its pursuit is thwarted
test1287,the story of fridolin and wretch's pretty outlines
test1288,sit down beside me and i'll tell you the story
test1289,he assisted it at but took no part and in fact was listening to that other conversation which sounded with its pleasant gable and laughter like a little musical tinkle of bells in the distance
test1290,but honest mark forgot that young ladies do not always come out quite alone and jump unassisted into their vehicles
test1291,but the middle son was little in lorraine he was neither dark nor fair he was neither handsome nor strong
test1292,throwing himself on his knees before the king he cried oh royal sayer bestow upon me also a sword and a steed that i may up and wait to follow my brothers
test1293,but the king laughed him to scorn thou a sword he said
test1294,in sooth thou shalt have one but it shall be one befiting thy maidens size and courage so small a weapon can be found in all my kingdom
test1295,fourth with the grinning gesture began shrieking with laughter so that the bells upon his mottled cap were all set to jangling
test1296,i but did not laugh to think that the sword of ethelred had been so quickly found responded the gesture and he pointed to the scissors hanging from the tailor's girdle
test1297,one night as he lay in a deep forest too unhappy to sleep he heard a noise near hand in the bushes
test1298,thou shalt have thy liberty he cried even though thou shalt run me in peace as the moment thou art not free
test1299,it had suddenly disappeared and in its place stood a beautiful fairy with filmy wings which shone like rainbows in the moonlight
test1300,at this moment there was a distant rumbling as of thunder tis the ogre cried the fairy we must hasten
test1301,sissors grow a giant's height and save us from the ogre's might.
test1302,he could see the ogre standing powerlessly to hurt him on the other side of the castle and nashing his teeth each one of which was as big as a millstone
test1303,the sight was so terrible that he turned on his heel and fled away as fast as his feet could carry him
test1304,you shall not be left a prisoner in this dismal spot while i have the power to help you
test1305,he lifted the scissors and with one stroke destroyed the web and gave the flocks freedom
test1306,a faint glimmer of light on the opposite wall shows me the keyhole
test1307,the prince spent all the following time until midnight trying to think of a suitable verse to say to the scissors
test1308,as he uttered the words the scissors leapt out of his hand and began to cut through the wooden shatters as easily as through a cheese
test1309,in a very short time the prints and crawled through the opening
test1310,while he stood looking around him in bewilderment a firefly alighted on his arm flashing its little lantern in the prince's face it cried this way my friend the fly sent me to guide you to a place of safety
test1311,what to become of me cried the poor peasant
test1312,my grain must fall and rot in the field from over ripeness because i have not the strength to rise and harvest it then indeed we must all starve
test1313,the great dame whom he supplied with faggots the merchant whom he rescued from robbers the king's counselor to whom he gave aid all became his friends up and down the land to beggar or lord homeless wanderer or high born dame he gladly gave unsound for service all unsound and such as he helped straight away became his friends
test1314,to him who could bring her back to her father's castle should be given the throne and kingdom as well as the princess herself so from far and near indeed from almost every country under the sun came knights and princes to fight the ogre
test1315,among those who drew back ethelred's brothers the three that were dark and the three that were fair
test1316,but ethel read he did not their taunts
test1317,so they all cried out long and loud long live the prince prince is all o
test1318,he felt what the earth may possibly feel at the moment when it is torn open with the iron in order that grain may be deposited within it it feels only the wound the quiver of the germ the joy of the fruit only arrived later
test1319,he had but just acquired a faith must he then reject it already
test1320,he affirmed to himself that he would not he declared to himself that he would not doubt and he began to doubt in spite of himself
test1321,to stand between two religions from one of which you have not yet emerged and another into which you have not yet entered is intolerable and twilight is pleasing only to bat like souls
test1322,marius was clear eyed and he required the true light
test1323,the half lights of doubt painted him
test1324,whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was he could not halt there he was irrevocably constrained to continue to advance to examine to think to march further
test1325,he feared after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father to now take a step which should estrange him from that father
test1326,his discomfort was augmented by all the reflections which occurred to him
test1327,in the troubled state of his conscience he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence
test1328,they soon elbow him abruptly
test1329,request corfe to come and talk with me said maria
test1330,what is to become of you said kurak
test1331,what are you going to do i do not know
test1332,silver gold here it is
test1333,you will then have only a pair of trousers a westcoat a hat and a coat and my boots
test1334,that will be enough
test1335,no it is not good what will you do after that
test1336,do you know german no
test1337,it is badly paid work but one can live by it
test1338,the clothes dealer was sent for.
test1339,he paid twenty francs for the cut-off garments they went to the watchmakers
test1340,he bought the watch for forty five francs
test1341,hello i'd forgotten that said simon
test1342,the landlord presented his bill which had to be paid on the spot
test1343,i have ten francs left said marie.
test1344,that will be swallowing a tongue very fast or a hundred sue very slowly
test1345,one morning on his return from the school marie has found a letter from his aunt and the sixty pistol that is to say six hundred francs and gold in a sealed box
test1346,marie sent back the third louie to his aunt with a respectful letter in which he stated that he had sufficient means to sustain himself and that he should be able to go forth to supply all his needs
test1347,at that moment he had three franks left
test1348,he perceived that it was no good talking to the old men and that the principal person in the house was the mother
test1349,before her he decided to scatter his pearls
test1350,the princess was distracted and did not know what to do she felt she had sinned against kitty
test1351,well doctor decide our fate said the princess tell me everything
test1352,is there hope she meant to say but her lips quivered and she could not utter the question well doctor
test1353,as you please the princess went out with a sigh
test1354,the family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his observations
test1355,and there are indications malnutrition nervous excitability and so on
test1356,the question stands thus in presence of indications of tuberculosis process what is to be done to maintain nutrition
test1357,yes that's an understood thing responded the celebrated physician again glancing at his watch
test1358,begone baden-baden i'll have to drive around
test1359,he asked ah it is
test1360,oh well i can do it in twenty minutes
test1361,and how about a tour abroad asked the family doctor
test1362,what is wanted is the means of improving nutrition and not for lowering it
test1363,the family doctor listened attentively and respectfully
test1364,but in favor of foreign travel i would urge the change of habits the removal from conditions calling up reminiscences
test1365,and then the mother wishes it she added
test1366,ah well in that case to be sure let them go only those greeks that are mischievous
test1367,oh time's up already and he went to the door
test1368,the celebrated doctor announced to the princess a feeling of which what was done from him dictated his doing so that he ought to see the patient once more
test1369,oh no only a few details princess come this way
test1370,and the mother accompanied by the doctor went into the drawing room to kitty
test1371,the doctor came in and she flushed crimson and her eyes were filled with tears
test1372,she answered him and at all once got up furious
test1373,excuse me doctor there is no really object in this
test1374,this is the third time you've asked me the same thing
test1375,the celebrated doctor did not offend
test1376,nervous irritability he said to the princess when kitty had left the room however i had finished
test1377,and the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess as an exceptionally intelligent woman the condition of the young princess and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters which were certainly harmless
test1378,at the question should they go abroad the doctor plunged into deep meditation as though resolving a weighty problem
test1379,finally his decision was pronounced they were to go abroad but to put no faith in foreign quacks and to apply to him in any need
test1380,it seemed as if some piece of good fortune had come to after the doctor had gone
test1381,the mother was much more cheerful when she went back to her daughter and kitty pretended to be more cheerful
test1382,educated people of the upper classes are trying to stigmatize the ever growing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social order
test1383,this is absolutely incorrect
test1384,in the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interest for the interest of the group
test1385,the champions of the social conception of life usually try to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea of moral influence but this connection is quite impossible
test1386,the man who is controlled by moral influence acts in accordance with his own desires
test1387,the basis of authority is bodily violence
test1388,the possibility of applying bodily violence to the people is provided above all by an organization of armed men trained to act in unity and submission to one will
test1389,these bands of armed men submitting to a single will are what constitute the army
test1390,the army has always been and still is the basis of power
test1391,power is always in the hands of those who control the army and all men in power from the roman caesars to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their army than in anything and court popularity in the army knowing that if that is on their side their power is secure
test1392,indeed it could not be otherwise
test1393,only under those conditions could the social organization be justified
test1394,but since this is not the case and on the contrary men are always far from being saints through the very fact of their possession of power the social organization based on power has no justification
test1395,even if there were once a time when owing to the low standards of morals and the disposition of men to violence the existence of an authority to restrict such violence was an advantage because the violence of the government was less the violence of individuals one cannot but see that this advantage could not be lasting
test1396,between the members of one state subject to a single authority the strain between the individuals seemed still less and the life of the state seems even more secure
test1397,it was produced on one hand by the natural growth of population and on the other by struggle and conquest
test1398,after conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to internal dissensions and so the state conception of life justifies itself
test1399,but this justification is never more than temporary
test1400,internal dissensions disappeared only in proportion to the degree of oppression exerted by the authority over the dissenting individuals
test1401,government authority even if it does not suppress private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the government
test1402,and therefore the oppression of the oppressed always goes on growing up to the fullest limit beyond which it cannot go without killing the goose with the golden eggs
test1403,the most convincing example of this is to be found in the condition of the working classes of our epoch who in reality know no better than the slaves of ancient times subdued by conquest
test1404,so it has always been
test1405,footnote the fact that in america the buccaneers of authority exist in spite of the small number of their troops not only fails to disprove this position but positively confirms it
test1406,the upper classes know that an army of fifty thousand will soon be insufficient and do longer rely on penitent men they feel that the security of their position depends on the increased strength of the army
test1407,the reason to which he gave expression is essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the popes engage swiss and scottish guards and makes the russian authorities of today so carefully distribute the recruits so that the regiments from the frontiers are stationed in central districts and the regiments from the center are stationed on the frontiers
test1408,the meaning of keppi's speech put in plain language is that funds are needed not to resist foreign forces but to under officers to be ready to act against the enslaved toiling masses
test1409,and this abnormal order of thanks is maintained by the army
test1410,but there is only one government there are other governments exploiting their subjects by violence in the same way and are always ready to pound down on any other government and carry off the fruits of its enslaved subjects
test1411,and so every government needs an army also to protect its bordermen
test1412,this increase is contagious as montesquieu pointed out a hundred and fifty years ago
test1413,every increase in the army of one state with the aim of self defense against its subjects becomes a source of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies
test1414,the despotism of a government always increases with the strength of the army and its external successes and the aggression of a government increases with its internal despotism
test1415,the rivalry of the european states in constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse to a universal military service since that means the greatest possible number of soldiers is obtained at the least possible expense
test1416,and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the inequalities practiced upon them all citizens have become their own impressors
test1417,this inconsistency has become obvious in universal military service
test1418,in fact the whole significance of the social conception of life consists in the recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transitoriness of personal life itself and the transference of the aim of life the groups of persons
test1419,but with universal military service it comes to pass that men after every sacrifice to get rid of the cruelty of strife and the insecurity of existence are called upon to face all the perils they had meant to avoid
test1420,but instead of doing that they exposed the individuals to the same necessity of strife substituting strife with individuals of other states for strife with neighbours
test1421,the taxes raised from the people for war preparations absorbed a greater part of the products of labor which the army ought to defend
test1422,the danger of war ever ready to break out renders all reforms of life social life vain and fruitless
test1423,but the fatal significance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent in the social conception of life is not only apparent in that
test1424,governments assert that armies are needed above all for external defense but that is not true
test1425,they are needed principally against their subjects and every man under military service becomes an accomplice and all the acts of violence of the government against the citizens without any choice of his own
test1426,and for the sake of what am i making
test1427,i am expected for the sake of a state to make these sacrifices to renounce everything that can be precious to man peace family security and human dignity
test1428,except from the state they say we should be exposed to the attacks of evil disposed persons in our own country
test1429,we now know that threats and punishments cannot diminish their number that can only be done by change of environment and moral influence
test1430,so that the justification of state violence on the ground of the protection that gives us from evil disposed persons even if it had some foundation or three centuries ago has none whatever now
test1431,except the state they tell us we should not have any religion education culture means of communication and so
test1432,without the state men would not have been able to form the social institutions needed for doing anything
test1433,this argument too was well founded only a few centuries ago
test1434,the great extension of means of communication and interchange of ideas has made men completely able to dispense with state aid in forming societies associations corporations and congresses for scientific economic and political objects
test1435,without governments nations were enslaved by their neighbours
test1436,the government they told us with its army is necessary to defend us from neighboring states that might enslaved us
test1437,and if defense against barbarian nations is meant one thousand part of the troops now under arms would be amply sufficient for that purpose
test1438,the power of the state far from being a security against the attacks of our neighbours exposes us on the contrary to much greater danger of such attacks
test1439,even looking at it practically weng that is to say all the burdens laid on him by the state no man can fail to see that for him personally to comply with the state demands and serve in the army would in the majority of cases be more disadvantageous than to refuse to do so
test1440,to resist would need independent thought and effort of which every man is not capable
test1441,so much for the advantages and disadvantages of both lines of conduct for a man of a wealthy class and an oppressor
test1442,for a man of the poor working class the advantages and disadvantages will be the same but with a great increase of disadvantages
test1443,say you know something
test1444,criss looked from a nickel plated flashlight to a car jack and spark plug
test1445,knows who needs a job ban that's jake arras
test1446,okay you said
test1447,only why didn't you ask him yourself
test1448,mike became uneasy and fished an elastic band out of his pocket made a flick of a paper and sent it soaring out into em street
test1449,well he admitted i did
test1450,chris asked and for the first time that day the heavy weight he carried within him lifted and illuminated a little
test1451,think he really needs it he pursued
test1452,he would have liked to get the job for jakey who needed it but somehow the task of facing mister wicker especially now that the light was going and dusk edged into the streets was not what chris had intended to end the afternoon
test1453,mike's expression changed to what once to one of triumph but griss was only partially encouraged
test1454,i bet you aren't going after all it turns down on him
test1455,mike was standing on the corner
test1456,oh shocks!
test1457,chris started off once more passing a bleak little victorian church perched on the hill above mister worker's house
test1458,an empty lot cut in to church lane gave a look of isolation to the ale shaped brick building that served mister wickers both house and place in business
test1459,the longer wing towards the back got a door that opened on a water street the space between the house and minneapolis avenue had been made into a neat oblong flower garden fenced off from the sidewalk by boxes and a white picket fence
test1460,a livid yellow stained the horizon beyond the factories and glaze clouds lower and tumbled above
test1461,the air was growing chill and chris decided to finish the job
test1462,all at once you wondered how his mother was and everything in him pinched and tightened itself
test1463,at the foot of the hill he reached the house
test1464,there were three things that always caught his eye amid the litter of dusty pieces
test1465,on the left the coil of rope in the center the model of a sailing ship in a green glass bottle and on the right the wooden statue of a negro boy and baggy trousers turkish jacket and white turban
test1466,but the name still showed at the prow and many a time chris safe at home and bed had sailed imaginative voyages in the mirabel
test1467,he had never seen anyone go into mister walker's shop now he thought of it.
test1468,how then did he live and what did he ever sell
test1469,a sudden car horn walked me from this dream
test1470,of many a time you examined mr. mister's window and poured over the rope the ship and the nubian boy he had never gone into mister's shop
test1471,so now alone until someone should answer the bell they looked eagerly if uneasily around him
test1472,what with the one window in the lower end of day outside the long narrow shop was somber
test1473,heavy hand and beam crossed it from one side to the other
test1474,scooter's back being toward the source of light chris could not see his face
test1475,the double fans and minute wrinkles breaking from eye corner to temple and joining with those over the cheekbones were drawn into the horizontal lines across the domed forehead
test1476,little tufts of white fuzz above the ears were all that remained of the antiquarian's hair but what drew and held chris's gaze were the old man's eyes
test1477,chris blinked and looked again yes they were still there
test1478,chris swaldon his voice came back to him
test1479,yes sir you said
test1480,i saw your sign and i know a boy who needs the job.
test1481,"he's a schoolmade man,"
test1482,"jackie harris's name is, and he really needs the job."
test1483,i i i wondered if the place was still open
test1484,what he saw was a fresh cheeked lad tall for thirteen sturdy with sincerity and good humour in his face and something sensitive and appealing about his eyes
test1485,he guessed there must be a lively fire in that room beyond
test1486,would that interfere with jaygie's getting the job sir
test1487,but even as he slowly turned the thought pierced his mind why had he not seen the reflection of the headlights of the cars moving up around the corner of wall utter street not the hill towards the lathific signals
test1488,the rooms seemed overly still
test1489,then in that second he turned and faced about
test1490,the wide bow window was there before him and three objects he liked best showing frosty on the moonlight that poured in from across the water
test1491,across the water where was the freeway
test1492,it was no longer there nor were the high walls and smokestacks of factories to be seen
test1493,the warehouses were still there.
test1494,flabbergasted and breathless chris was unaware that he had moved closer to peer out the window in every direction
test1495,no electric signs no lamp post streets
test1496,where the people's drug store stood but half an hour before rose the roof of what was evidently an in
test1497,a courtyard was first lit by flaring torture two showing a swinging sign hung on a post
test1498,the post was planted at the edge of it which was now a broad and money road
test1499,a coach with its top piled high with luggage stamped to a halt beside the flagged courtyard
test1500,they moved into the inn the cook rattled off to the stable
test1501,my window has a power for those few who are to see
test1502,the learning of magic was by no means easy
test1503,he told him his master at once about simon gosler his hoard of money and his hiding places for it
test1504,chris therefore threw himself into all the preliminaries of his task
test1505,one afternoon when he had returned after arrest to mister walker's study he saw that there was something new in the room a bull with a goldfish in it stood on the table but mister walker is not to be seen
test1506,what shall i do first
test1507,how you've improved proved my boy he exclaimed there's now a time for you to try and this is a way to change as any
test1508,suppose i change and can't change back
test1509,master walker waited patiently beside him for a few moments for chris to get up his courage
test1510,then there is nothing happened with a voice like a whip mister wicker said started once
test1511,a sensation spread faster and faster
test1512,his head swam and he felt faint and a little sick but he resisted through the final words
test1513,he thought not without a feeling of pride and began experimenting with his tail and fins with such enthusiasm and delight that some little time elapsed before mister walker's voice boomed away
test1514, seventy four book one the return
test1515,the figure shoes carved in some eastern style at curved upturned toes
test1516,then all that once the idea came to chris
test1517,if he wants to be a magician could he make this boy come to life?
test1518,he squatted on his haunches examined the carved wood and figure attentively and felt convinced that once alive the boy would be an ideal and happy companion
test1519,but how did one change inanimate to animate
test1520,chris got up and stole back to mister walker's door
test1521,you heard that magician going up the spiral staircase to his room above and after changing himself to a mouse to slip under the door and see that the room was reeling empty mister dooms proper shape and opened the doors of the cupboard at the far end of the room
test1522,the afternoon rainy before increased in storm
test1523,thus gained two hours before its time thunder snarls in the sky
test1524,certain elements were to be mixed and poured at the proper time
test1525,workman began moving about upstairs the floorboards creaked creak creak and still chris could not leave until the potion fumed and glowed
test1526,with infinite caution chris closed the doors silently behind him and running lightly forward reached the figure the negro boy
test1527,it was as if the stiffness melted
test1528,under his eyes woven threads of cloth became rich silk embroidery gleamed in its reality upon the coat and oh the face
test1529,the wooden grin loosened the large eyes turned the hand holding the hard bouquet of carved flowers moved then the bouquet fall
test1530,they went down to their quarters first
test1531,guess mister finley went to his quarters i don't remember seeing him cross the deck or come over that way at all
test1532,next ned silly was reeling to the helm by elbert jones who took over ned went on down
test1533,it looks to me as if it could have been one of several people and i'll be switched if i know who i'll keep my eyes open
test1534,the mirror bell was nearing theodore
test1535,we've watered and fresh stores to tickle on there
test1536,chris lost no time as soon as he could do it without being noticed in hurrying down to his cabin
test1537,certainly my boy blew up the captain's blue eyes abruptly keen in penetrating
test1538,mister finley would be some time on deck we cannot be otherwise heard in here
test1539,his face rose with nervousness that this might not do as an answer and he stood stiff and still before captain lizard
test1540,the captain sat forward in his chair looking at him for a long moment considering
test1541,then he said well well i do not care for it i cannot say that i do
test1542,this ship is more to me than wife or mother or family
test1543,paws fingered his lower lip looking sideways in a reflective fashion at chris standing before him
test1544,we shall say no more but i trust you understand the responsibility you have
test1545,this ship its cargo and its men will be in your hands
test1546,yes sir i think i can do it safely or i should not try you sir
test1547,captain blizzard's round pink face crested in its winning smile
test1548,he then went on to describe what else was to follow the covering of the ship with leaves to make it blend with its surroundings
test1549,camouflage was not a word the captain or anyone else of his time had yet understood
test1550,what can be said during that time sir christos asked
test1551,i am somewhat skilled in medicine i have to be as a captain of a ship and the crew know it
test1552,i shall say that you are in my own cabin so that i can care for you
test1553,not since he had left mister wucker and chris felt such confidence as he did in the words and actions of captain blizzard
test1554,he knew now that his absence for as long as he had had to be away would be covered up and satisfactorily accounted for
test1555,their conversation had taken some little while.
test1556,in churchyards yon
test1557,i knew well enough that he might be carried thousands of miles in the box car locked in perhaps without water or food
test1558,i am sure i kissed lady and i've had terrible moments since when i seem to remember kissing mister jameson too with the excitement
test1559,fortunately warned the detective who were keeping bachelor hall in the lodge
test1560,out of deference to leddy they washed their dishes once a day and a concoted queer messes according to their several abilities
test1561,miss inns he said stopping me as i was about to go to my room upstairs how are your nerves tonight
test1562,i have none i said happily
test1563,i mean he persisted do you feel as though you could go through with something rather unusual
test1564,the most unusual thing i can think of would be a peaceful night
test1565,something is going to occur he said
test1566,put on heavy shoes and some old dark clothes and make up your mind not to be surprised at anything
test1567,lily was sleeping the sleep of the just when i went up stairs and i hunted out my things cautiously
test1568,they were talking confidently together but when i came down they ceased
test1569,there were a few preparations to be made the locks to be gone over winters to be instructed after renewed vigilance and then after extinguishing the whole light we crept in the darkness through the front door and into the night
test1570,i asked no questions
test1571,once only somebody spoke and then it was an enigmatic bit of profanity from doctor stewart when he ran into a wire fence
test1572,i only know what i expected
test1573,the doctor was puffing somewhat where we finally came to a halt
test1574,i confess that just at that minute even sunny side seemed a cheerful spot
test1575,in spite of myself i drew my breath sharply
test1576,it was alex arm'd the two long handled spades
test1577,the doctor kept a keen lookout but no one appeared
test1578,there's one thing sure i won't be suspected of complacency
test1579,a doctor is generally supposed to be a handier at bearing folks than a tigging them up
test1580,i held onto him frantically and somehow i got taren looked down
test1581,but how i am i to get over the ten or twelve days that must yet elapse before they go
test1582,for none could injure me as he has done oh
test1583,the word stirs me in the face like a guilty confession but it is true i hate him i hate him
test1584,i sometimes i think i should give him credit for the good feeling he simulated so well and then again i think it is my duty to suspect him under the peculiar circumstances in which i am placed
test1585,i have done well to record them minutely
test1586,they had taken themselves to their work i least divert my mind then to depreciate conversation i provided myself with the book
test1587,i am too well acquainted with your character and conduct to feel any real friendship for you and as i am without your talent for the simulation i cannot assume the appearance of it
test1588,upon prodding this she turned carlotta and bit her lip
test1589,you may go milton until following a while milton point
test1590,ulysses blytheellen continued she
test1591,ha ha you are suspicious
test1592,if i was suspicious i replied i should have discovered your infamy long before
test1593,i enjoy human life rambles as well as you i answered steadily fixing my eyes up on her and in february happens to be one of my favorite resorts
test1594,she colored again excessively and remained silent pressing your finger against her cheeks and gazing into the fire
test1595,i watched her a few moments to the feeling of malevolent gratification then moving towards the door i calmly asked if she had any thing more to say
test1596,yes yes
test1597,suppose i do
test1598,she paused in evident disconsolation and perplexity mingled with anger she dare not show
test1599,i cannot renounce what is dearer in life she murmured in a low hard tone
test1600,if you are generous here is a fitting opportunity for the exercise of your magnanimity if you are proud here am i an rival rather than acknowledge myself your adopter for an act of the most noble forbearance
test1601,i shall not tell him
test1602,give me no thanks it is not for your sector i refrain
test1603,and melissa would tell her
test1604,i will not for much as you should know infamy and disgrace of a relation
test1605,you use artful words madam missenden but i can pardon you
test1606,how dare you mention his name to me
test1607,it seems very interesting love said he lifting his head and turning to where his eyes stood ringing my hand in silent rage and anger but it's rather long i look at it some other time and meanwhile i'll trouble you for your kiss my dear what kiss
test1608,the keys of your cabinet desk drawer and whatever else you possess said he rising and holding out his hand
test1609,the key of my desk in fact was at that moment in the lock and the others were attached to it
test1610,now then sneered he we must have a confiscation of property
test1611,and putting the keys into his pocket he walked into the library
test1612,that and all replied the master and the things were cleared away
test1613,mister huntington then went up stairs
test1614,notter he's starting back she's very devil for a spy
test1615,i didn't say i had broken it did i returned he
test1616,i shall put you up in a small monthly allowance in future for your own private expenses and you wouldn't even trouble yourself any more about my concerns i shall look out for a student my dear i won't expose you to the temptation
test1617,and as for the household matters missus grimes must be very particular in keeping her accounts we must go up on an entirely new plan
test1618,what great discovery have you made now mister huntington
test1619,i have attempted to deceive you
test1620,not in money matters exactly it seems but it's best to keep out of the way of temptation
test1621,here benson entered the candles and there followed the brief interval of silence i sitting still in my chair and he is standing with his back to the fire silently trying thing in my despair
test1622,i know that day after day such feelings return upon me
test1623,i tried to look at him and raised my heart to heaven but it will clift to the dust
test1624,then hope i fear
test1625,mister and missus hawthorne i've been seeing it to go before a fortnight and as mister hawthorne's garden is still absent and the weather was remarkably fine i never passed the time without seeing my two friends milton and aster either there or here
test1626,no unless you tell me what to expect him home
test1627,i can't you don't want him do you
test1628,it is a resolution you are performed long ago
test1629,we all have a bit of a liking for him at the bottom of our hearts though we can't respect him
test1630,no i'd rather be like myself than as i am
test1631,never mind my plain speaking said i it is from the best motives
test1632,but tell me should you wish your sons to be like mister huntington or even like yourself
test1633,oh no i couldn't understand that
test1634,fire and fury
test1635,now don't force into a tempest at the head
test1636,but hang it it's not my fault
test1637,not years for she's only five and twenty
test1638,what would you make of me and the children to be sure that were hurt death between them
test1639,i know they are blessed them
test1640,it followed me into the library
test1641,i sought awton to put into his hands two of millett's letters one dated from london and written during one of his oldest seasons of reckless dissipation the other in the country during a lucid interval
test1642,the former was full of trouble and anger not accusing him but deeply regretting his connection with his profligate companions abusing mister grimsby and others inciting bitter things against mister huntington and most ingeniously throwing the blame of her husband's misconduct on the other man's shoulders
test1643,i've been a cursed rascal god knows said he as he gave it an urchin's squeeze but you see if i don't make a man for it then me if i don't
test1644,if you intend to reform invoke god's blessing is mercy in this aid not his curse
test1645,god help me then for i am sure i need it
test1646,where is milnesent
test1647,nay not i said he turning around and pushing it towards me
test1648,millefleur to thank me overwhelming its gratitude
test1649,cried she i couldn't have influenced him i'm sure by anything that i could have said
test1650,you never tried me melye said he
test1651,after that they will prepare to their country home
test1652,captain leigh did not look at all like london dandy now.
test1653,there was a very natural savagery and jealousy there and a wild leer in his yellow eyes rachel sat down
test1654,a slave only think a slave
test1655,oh frightful frightful is it a dream?
test1656,"oh frightful, treacherous,"
test1657,"stanley, stanley it would be mercy to kill me she broke her again."
test1658,bright and natty with the jins curtains and the little toilet set out not in elegantly and her pet pipping goldfrench asleep on his perch with a bit of sugar between the wires of his cage her pillow so white and unpressed with its little edging of lace
test1659,when he came back to the drawing room a toilet bowl over the colonnade in his hand with her lace handkerchief he bathed her temples in forehead
test1660,there was nothing very brotherly in his look as he peered into a pale sharp features during the process.
test1661,there don't mind me she said sharply and getting up she looked down at her dress and thin shoes and seeming to recollect herself she took the candle he had just set down and went swiftly to her room
test1662,and she threw back her veil and going hastily to the toilet mechanically surveyed herself in the glass
test1663,"rachel leek, rachel leek, what are you now?"
test1664,i'll stay here that is in the drawing room she answered and the face was withdrawn
test1665,he slacked a space and tapped sharply at the little window of the maddest post office at which the young ladies in the pony carriage had picked up the day before and within which luke waggott was wanted to sleep in a sort of wooden box that folded up and appeared to be a chest of drawers all day
test1666,luke took care of mister lakin's dogs and groomed mister wilder's horse and cleaned up his dog cart for mark being close about money and finding that the thing was to be done more cheaply that way put up his horse and dog cart in the post office premises and so evaded the delivery charges of the brandon arms
test1667,but luke was not there and captain lake recalling his habits and his haunt hurried on to the silver lion which has its cable towards the common only about a hundred steps away for distances are not great in jillydine
test1668,"here where the flow of soul and of stout long pipes, long yarns and tolerably long credits and the humble keg races of the town resided tigger for the pleasures of a club life and often reviled deep into the small hours of the morning"
test1669,lost no time and i'll give you half a crown.
test1670,luke stockton is homeless and greasy wide awake and in a few minutes more the dog cart was stumbled out into the lane and the horse harness went between the shafts with that wonderful cheerfulness with which they bear to be called up under startling circumstances at unsual hours
test1671,if i thought you'd failed me now to morrow i should never come back goodnight to morrow.
test1672,the act said that in case of difference of opinion there must be a ballot
test1673,he went up to the table and striking it with his finger ring he shouted loudly a ballot
test1674,he was shouting for the very coarse sergey ivanovitch had proposed but it was evident that he hated him and all his party and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and roused in opposition to it the same indignation though in a more seemingly form on the other side
test1675,shouts were raised and for a moment all was confusion so that the marshal of the province had to call for order a ballot
test1676,we shed our blood for our country.
test1677,the confidence of the monarch no checking the accounts of the marshal he is not a cashier but that's not the point
test1678,votes please busy
test1679,they expressed the most implacable hatred
test1680,living did not in the least understand what was a matter and he marveled at the passion with which it was disputed whether or not the decision about flareff should be put to the vote
test1681,he forgot as sergey ivanov explained to him afterwards this sycophancy that it was necessary for the public good to get rid of the marshal of the province that to get rid of the marshal it was necessary to have a majority of votes that to get a majority of votes it was necessary to secure florenov's right to vote that to get rid of the marshal it was necessary to have a majority of votes that to get a majority of votes it was necessary to secure florenov's right to vote that to get rid of the marshal of the province that to get rid of the marshal it was necessary to have a majority of votes that to get a majority of votes it was necessary to secure florenov's right to vote that to get rid of the marshal of the province that to get rid of the marshal it was necessary to have a majority of votes that to get a majority of votes it was necessary to secure florenov's right to vote that to get rid of
test1682,but levin forgot all that and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons for whom he had a respect in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement
test1683,to escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was no one except the waiters at the freshest bar
test1684,he particularly liked the way one grey whiskered waiter who showed his scorn for the other younger ones and was jeered at by them which was teaching them how to fold up napkins properly
test1685,living in advance but utterly forgetting what he was to do and much embarrassed he turned to sergey ivanovitch with a question where am i to put it
test1686,serves you even a wicked brown
test1687,that is a matter for each man's decision he said severely
test1688,having put it in he recalled that he ought to thrust his left hand too and so he thrust it in though too late and still more overpowered with confusion he beat a hasty retreat into the background
test1689,a hundred and twenty five for admission ninety eight against
test1690,sang the voice of the secretary who could not pronounce the letter a
test1691,then there was a laugh a button and two nots were found in the box
test1692,but the old party did not consider themselves conquered
test1693,in reply snetkoff spoke of the trust the noblemen of the province had placed in him the affronts they had shown him which he did not deserve as his only merit had been his attachment to the nobility to whom he had devoted twelve years of service
test1694,this expression in the marshall's face was particularly touching to levin because only the day before he had been at his house about his trusty business and had seen him in all his grandeur a kind hearted fatherly man
test1695,if there are men younger and more deserving than i let them serve
test1696,and the marshal disappeared through a side door
test1697,they were to proceed immediately to the election
test1698,two noble gentlemen who had a weakness for strong drink had been made drunk by the partisans of snetkoff and a third had been robbed of his uniform
test1699,on learning this the new party had made haste during the dispute about flaroff to send some of their men in a sleigh to clothe the stripped gentlemen and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting
test1700,levin did not care to eat and he was not smoking he did not want to join his own friends that is sergey evgenyevich stepan arkadyevich svyatsky and the rest because bernstein in an equatorial uniform was standing with them in eager conversation
test1701,he went to the window and sat down scanning the groups and listening to what was being said around him
test1702,he's such a black card
test1703,i have told him so but it makes no difference only think of it
test1704,these persons were unimaginably seeking a place where they could talk without being overheard
test1705,shall we go on your excellence fine champagne
test1706,last year at our district marshal nicole evans
test1707,oh still just the same always a loss the landowner answered with a resigned smile but with an expression of serenity and conviction that so it must be
test1708,why what is there to understand?
test1709,there is no meaning in it at all
test1710,then two one must keep up appearances
test1711,it's a moral obligation of a sacrifice
test1712,and then to tell the truth there's one's own interests
test1713,they are proprietors of a sort but we are the landowners
test1714,that it may be but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully
test1715,if we are laying out a garden planning one before the house you know and there you have a tree that stood with centuries in the very spot old and gnarled it may be and yet you don't cut down the old fellow to make room for the flower beds but leave out your beds so as to take advantage of the tree
test1716,well and how is your land doing
test1717,but one's work is stowed in nothing
test1718,oh well one does it what would you have
test1719,and what's more the landowner went on leaning his elbows on the window and chatting on my son i must tell you has no taste for it
test1720,so there will be no one to keep it up and yet one does it
test1721,we walked about the fields and the garden no sir jefferson stonewall everything's well looked after but your gardens neglected
test1722,to my thinking i'd cut down the line
test1723,here you have thousands of limes and each would make two good bundles of bark
test1724,you're married i heard said the landowner
test1725,yes it's rather strange he went on
test1726,the landowner chuckled under his white mustaches
test1727,why don't we cut down our parks for tumbler?
test1728,said eleven returning to a thought that rudd struck him
test1729,there is a class instinct too of what one ought or ought not to do
test1730,there's the peasants too i wonder at them sometimes any good peasant tries to take all the land he can
test1731,without a return to other a simple loss
test1732,when he came from the bath proclus visited him again
test1733,but herman was not in the mood to share a joyful revel and he frankly said so although immediately after his return he had accepted the invitation to the festival which the whole fellowship of artists would give the following day in honor of the seventeenth birthday of the old sculptor uffner
test1734,she would appear herself at dessert and the banquet must therefore begin at an unusual early hour
test1735,so the artist found himself obliged to relent his opposition
test1736,the banquet was to begin in a few hours yet he could not let the day pass without seeing daphne and telling her the words of the oracle
test1737,he longed with ardent yearning for the sound of her voice and still more to unburden his sorely troubled soul to her
test1738,since his return from the oracle the fear that the rescue demetrius might yet be the work of mertillus had again mastered him
test1739,the approval as well as the doubts which had arisen in others strengthened his opinion although even now he could not succeed in bringing it into harmony with the facts
test1740,then he went directly to the neighboring palace the queen might have appeared already and it would not do to keep her waiting
test1741,hitherto the merchant had been induced it is true to advance large sums of money to the queen but the loyal devotion which he showed to her royal husband had rendered it impossible to give him even a hint of the conspiracy
test1742,when herman entered the residents of the gromatius in the palace the guests had already assembled
test1743,the place by herman's side which althea had chosen for herself would then be given up to arsenal
test1744,true and interesting conversation still had power to charm him but often during its continuance the full consciousness of his misfortune forced itself upon his mind for the majority of the subjects discussed by the artists came to them through the medium of sight and referred to new creations of architecture sculpture and painting from whose enjoyment his blindness forbade him
test1745,a stranger out of his own sphere he fell chilled among these closely united men and women to whom no tie bound him save the presence of the same host
test1746,creeds had really been invited in order to win him over to the queen's cause but charming fair harry nye had been commissioned by the conspirators to persuade him to sing arsinoe's praises among his professional associates
test1747,his son had been the royal dame's first husband and she had deserted him to marry leslace the aged king of thrace
test1748,the king's sister the object of his love cried harman and credulously
test1749,we woman are only as old as we look and the leeches intreating woman of this beauty of forty practice arts which give her appearance of twenty five yet perhaps the king values her intellect more than her person and the wisdom of a hundred serpents is certainly united in this woman's head
test1750,the three most trustworthy ones are here amethysts the leech crystaline and the admirable proclus
test1751,let us hope that you will make this three leaved clover the luck promising four leaved one
test1752,your uncle too has often with praised worthy generosity helped artono in many an embarrassment
test1753,how long he kept you waiting from the first word concerning a work which justly transported the whole city with delight
test1754,when he did finally summon you he said things which must have warned you
test1755,that is going to far replied herman
test1756,he winked at her and made a significant gesture as he spoke and then informed the blind artist how graciously arsene had remembered him when she heard of the remedy by whose aid many a wonderful cure of blind eye had been made in roads
test1757,the royal lady had inquired about him and his sufferings with almost sisterly interest and althea eagerly confirmed the statement
test1758,her mom listened to the parents silence
test1759,the radian was just beginning to praise arsinoe also as a special friend and consular of the sculptures art when crates herman's fellow student asked the blind artist in behalf of his beautiful companion why his demeeter was placed upon a pedestal wall which to others as well as himself seemed too high for the size of the statue
test1760,yet what mattered it even if these miserable people considered themselves deceived and pointed the finger of scorn at him
test1761,a woman who yearns for the regard of all men and makes a toy easily lessens the demand she imposes upon individuals
test1762,only even though love has wholly disappeared she still claims consideration and althea did not wish to lose hernan's regard
test1763,how indifferent you look but i tell you her deep blue eyes flashed as she spoke that so long as you were still a genuine creating artist the case was different
test1764,though so loud a denial is written on your face i persisted in my conviction and that no idle delusion and snazzy me i can prove
test1765,it was nay nay it could have been nothing else that very spider
test1766,not a sound if you value your lives
test1767,to offer resistance would have been madness for even herman perceived by the loud clanking of weapons around them the greatly superior power of the enemy and they were acting by the orders of the king to the prison near the place of execution
test1768,was he to be led to the executioners block
test1769,what pleasure had life to offer him the blind man who was already dead to his art
test1770,would he not to greet his sudden end as a blow from the immortals
test1771,did it not spare him a humiliation as great and painful as could be imagined
test1772,whatever might await him he desired no other fate
test1773,if he had passed into annihilation he hermon would wish to follow him further and annihilation certainly meant redemption from pain and misery
test1774,but if they were destined to meet his burlesque and his mother in the world beyond the grave what had he not to tell them how sure he was he was a finding a joyful reception there from both
test1775,the power which delivered him over to death just at that moment was not nemesis no it was a kindly deity
test1776,yet it was no illusion that deceived him
test1777,again he heard the beloved voice and this time it addressed not only him but with the utmost haste the commander of the soldiers
test1778,sometimes with touching and treaty sometimes with imperious command she protested after giving him her name that this matter could be nothing but an unfortunate mistake
test1779,lastly with earnest warmth she beset him before taking the prisoners away to permit her to speak to the commanding general philippus her father's guest who she was certain was in the palace
test1780,cried herman and grateful agitation but she would not listen to him and follow the soldier whom the captain detailed to guide her into the palace
test1781,tomorrow you shall confess to me who treacherously directed you to this dangerous path
test1782,daphne again pleaded for the liberation of the prisoners but while his silence charmed with the grave exclamation the order of the king
test1783,as soon as the captive artist was alone with the woman he loved he clasped her hand pouring forth incoherent words of the most ardent gratitude and when he felt her warmly return the pressure he could not restrain the desire to clasp her to his heart
test1784,in spite of his deep mental distress he could have shouted aloud in his delight and gratitude
test1785,he might now have been permitted to bind forever to his life the woman who had just rescued him from the greatest danger but the confession he must make to his fellow artists in the pulpit of the following morning still sealed his lips yet in this hour he felt that he was united to her and ought not to conceal what awaited him so obeying a strong impulse he exclaimed you know that i love you
test1786,i love you and have loved you always
test1787,davina exclaimed tenderly what more is needed
test1788,but herman with drooping head murmured to morrow i shall no longer be what i am now
test1789,then daphne raised her face to his asking so the demeter is the worker of mortals
test1790,what a terrible ordeal again awaits you
test1791,and i fool blind also in mind could be vexed with you for it
test1792,bring this before your mind and everything else that you must accept with it if you consent when the time arrives to become mine conceal and pilate nothing
test1793,so caracas intended to leave the city on one of his own ships that very day
test1794,he himself on the way to expose himself to the malice and mockery of the whole city
test1795,his heart contracted painfully and his solicitor about his uncle's fate increased when philippe informed him that the conspirators had been arrested at the banquet end headed by emilentes the rodrigues the rodrigues the rodrigues had perished by the executioner's sword at sunrise
test1796,besides he knew that the object of his love would not part from him without granting him one last word
test1797,on the way his heart throbbed almost to bursting
test1798,even daphne's image and what threatened her father and with her he proceeded far into the background
test1799,he was appearing before his companions only to give truth it's just do
test1800,the egyptian obeyed and his master crossed the wide space strewn with sand and approached the stage which had been erected for the festive performances even had his eyes retained the power of sight his blood was coursing so wildly through his veins that he might perhaps have been unable to distinguish the statues around him and the thousands of spectators who crowded closely together richly garlanded their cheeks glowing with enthusiasm surrounded the arena herman
test1801,shouted his friend sartoris and joyful surprise in the midst of his painful walk hermanon
test1802,even while he believed himself to be the creator of the demeter he had been seriously troubled by the praise of so many critics because it had exposed him to the suspicion of having become faithless to his art and his nature
test1803,honour to merlotis and his art but he trusted the noble festal assembly would pardon the unintended deception and aid his prayer for recovery
test1804,afterwards it was supposed that he was satisfied with the blood of oxen lamps and devils and that in exchange for or in account of these sacrifices this god gave rain sunshine and harvest
test1805,whether he was the creator of your self and myself
test1806,whether and any prayer was ever answered
test1807,why did he create an intellectual inferior
test1808,why did he create the deformed and helpless why did he create the criminal the idiotic the insane
test1809,are the failures and obligation to their creator
test1810,is he responsible for all the wars that have been waged for all the innocent blood that has been shed
test1811,is he responsible for the centuries of slavery for the backs that have been scarred with a lash for the babies that have been sold from the breasts of mothers for the families that have been separated and destroyed
test1812,is this god responsible for religious persecution for the inquisition for the thumb screw and rack and for all the instruments of torture
test1813,did this get allowed the cruel and vile to destroy the brave and virtuous
test1814,did he allow tyrants to shed a blood of patriots
test1815,can we conceive of a devil bessed enough to prefer his enemies to his friends
test1816,how can we account for the wild beasts that the devour human beings for the fanged serpents whose bite is death
test1817,how can we account for whom world life feeds on life
test1818,did infinite wisdom intentionally produce the microscopic beasts that feed upon the optics think of blinding a man to satisfy the appetite of a microbe
test1819,fear builds the altar and offers the sacrifice
test1820,fear erected the cathedral and bowed the head of man in worship
test1821,lits religious and fearful trembling repeat his passage though he slays me yet will i trust him
test1822,can we say that he cared for the children of man
test1823,can we say that is mercy endured forever
test1824,do you prove his goodness by showing that he has opened the earth and swallowed thousands of his helpless children or that with the volcanoes he has overwhelmed them with rivers of fire
test1825,was their goodness was their wisdom in this
test1826,or the superior race to signaut that they are not the inferior
test1827,most people linked to the supernatural
test1828,if they give up one god they imagine another
test1829,what is this power
test1830,man advances and necessarily advances to experience
test1831,a man wishing to go to a certain place comes to where the road divides
test1832,he has tried that road and knows that it is the wrong road
test1833,a child shown by the beauty of the flame grasped it with his dimpled hand
test1834,the power that works for righteousness had taught the child a lesson
test1835,it is a result
test1836,it is insisted by these theologians and by many of the so called philosophers that this moral sense this sense of duty of obligation was important and that conscience is an exotic
test1837,we live together in families tribes and nations
test1838,they are praised admired and respected
test1839,they are regarded as good that is to say as moral
test1840,the members who added to the misery of the family the tribe of the nation are considered bad members
test1841,the greatest of human beings had said conscience is born of love
test1842,as people advance the remote consequences are perceived
test1843,the imagination is cultivated
test1844,a man puts himself in the place of another
test1845,the sense of duty becomes stronger more imperative
test1846,man judges himself
test1847,in all this there is nothing supernatural
test1848,man has deceived himself
test1849,has christianity done good
test1850,when the church had control were men made better and happier
test1851,what has religion done for hungary or greece
test1852,could these countries have been worse without religion
test1853,could they have been worse had they had any other religion than christianity
test1854,what did christianity do for them
test1855,they hated pleasure
test1856,they muffled all the bells of gladness
test1857,the religion of the puritans was an unadulterated curse
test1858,the puritans believed the bible to be the word of god and this belief has always made those who held it cruel and wicked
test1859,let me refer to just one fact showing the influence of a belief in the bible on human beings
test1860,the queen received the bible kissed it and pledged herself to diligently read darin
test1861,in other words it was just as feindish just as infamous as the catholic spirit
test1862,has the bible made the people of georgia kind and merciful
test1863,religion has been tried and in all countries in all times has failed
test1864,religion has always been the enemy of science of investigation and thought
test1865,religion has never made men free
test1866,it has never made man moral temperate industrious and honest
test1867,are christians more temperate nearer virtuous nearer honest than savages
test1868,can we cure disease by supplementation
test1869,can we receive virtue or hanner as arms
test1870,religion rests on the idea that nature has a master and that this master will listen to prayer that this master punishes and rewards that he loves praise and flattery and hates the brave and free
test1871,we must have corned the stones
test1872,the structure must have a basin
test1873,if we build we must begin at the bottom
test1874,i have a theory and i have four cornersstones
test1875,the first stone is that matter substance cannot be destroyed cannot be annihilated
test1876,if these cornstones are facts it follows as a necessity that matter and force are from and to eternity that they can neither be increased nor diminished
test1877,it follows that nothing has been or can be created that there never has been or can be a creator
test1878,it followed that there could not have been any intelligence any design back of matter and force
test1879,i say what i think
test1880,every event has parents
test1881,that which has not happened could not
test1882,in the infinite chain of wrists and there can be no broken no missing link
test1883,we now know that our first parents were not foreigners
test1884,we now know if we know anything that the universe is natural and that man and woman have been naturally produced
test1885,we know the parts that life has traveled
test1886,we know the footsteps of advance they have been traced
test1887,for thousands of years men and women have been trying to reform the world
test1888,why have the reformers failed
test1889,they depend on the lord on luck and charity
test1890,they live by fraud and violence and bequeath their vices to the children
test1891,failure seems to be the trademark of nature why
test1892,nature produced without purpose sustains without intention and destroys without thought
test1893,must the world for ever remain the victim of ignorant passion
test1894,why should men and women have children that they cannot not take care of children that are a burden and curses why
test1895,passion is and always has been death
test1896,law can punish but it can neither reform criminals nor prevent crime
test1897,this cannot be done by talk or example
test1898,this is the solution of the whole question
test1899,this freezes women
test1900,poverty and crime will be childless
test1901,it is far better to be free to leave the fears and barricades of fear to stand erect and face the future with a smile
test1902,there done for said the schoolmaster in a low key to the shrewet out with your vitriol and mind your eye
test1903,the two monsters took off their shows and moved stealthily along keeping in the shadows of the houses
test1904,by means of this stratagem they followed so closely that although within a few steps of sarah and tom they did not hear them
test1905,sarah and her brother having again passed by the tuppfrank arrived close to the dilapidated house which was partly in ruins and its open cellars formed a kind of gulf along which the street ran in that direction
test1906,in an instant the school master with a leap resembling strength and agility the spring of a tiger seized sitting with one hand by the throat and exclaimed your money or i will fling you into this hole
test1907,no said the old brood tremblingly no not one ringing what a shame
test1908,tom seitan did not lose his presence of mind during this scene rapidly and unexpectedly as it had occurred
test1909,oh ah to lay a trap to catch us replied the thief
test1910,then addressing thomas seitan you know the plain of saint deni
test1911,did you see in the cabaret we had just left for i know you again the man whom the charcoalman came to seek
test1912,cried the schoolmaster a thousand francs and i'll kill him
test1913,witch i do not see his life replied sarah to the schoolmaster
test1914,let's go and meet him
test1915,all by it will pay for looking after
test1916,well my wife shall be there said the school master you will tell her what you want and i shall see
test1917,in the plain of saint nee
test1918,between saint eustace and the road of revolt at the end of the road agreed
test1919,he had forgotten the address of the self-styled pan painter
test1920,the fiacca started
test1921,france who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to arbert's request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and
test1922,my very good friend an excellent neighbour replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exertions
test1923,my father the count de morse although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of france and madrid and i hesitatingly place the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal
test1924,i can scarcely credit it
test1925,then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated
test1926,shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour in quiet the count only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements day by day hour by hour said albert that will suit me to a dot
test1927,so it be it then replied the counts and extending his hand towards the calendar suspended near the chimney piece he said today is the twenty first of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly half past ten clock now promised me to remember this and expect me the twenty first of may at the same hour in the forenoon
test1928,i reside in my father's house but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard and tile is separated from the main building
test1929,now then set the count returning his tablets to his pocket make yourself perfectly easy the hand of your time piece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself
test1930,that depends when do you leave
test1931,for france no for venice i shall remain in italy for another year or two
test1932,then we shall not meet in paris
test1933,i fear i shall not have that honour
test1934,well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young men allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey
test1935,what is the matter asked albert of france when they had returned to their own apartments you seem more than commonly thoughtful
test1936,i will confess to you albert replied france the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions
test1937,did you ever meet him previously to coming hither
test1938,upon my honor then listen to me
test1939,he dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the brothel of the thousand and one nights he recounted with circumspect exactitude all the particularities of the supper the hashish the statues the dream and how at his awakening there remained no proof of trace of these events except the small yard seen in the distant
test1940,then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the coliseum between the count and vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit pepin an engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled
test1941,but said francis the corcadian bandits that were among the crew of his vessel
test1942,why really the thing seems to me simple enough
test1943,talking of countries replied france of what countries the counts what is his native tongue when does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early life a life as marvelous as unknown that have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a melancholy
test1944,certainly these are questions that in your place i should like to have answered
test1945,my dear france replied albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the count's assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend albert the moreau is in danger helped me to deliver him
test1946,what are his means of existence what is his birthplace of what countries is he native
test1947,i confess he asked me none no he merely came and freed me from the hands of senior vampire where i can assure you in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and concern i did not very particularly care to remain
test1948,and this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on albert's side
test1949,well said francis with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation
test1950,and now my dear france let us talk of something else
test1951,then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination albert de marsey could follow up his researchers by means of a small gate similar to that close to the concierge's store and which merits a particular description
test1952,shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate
test1953,at a quarter to ten a valiant entered he composed with a little room name john and who only spoke english all albert's establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the count of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the count of the hotel was always at his service
test1954,wait then during the day tell rosea that when i leave the opera i will sup with her as she wishes
test1955,very well at half ten
test1956,is the count down yet
test1957,the valley left the room
test1958,good morning raphael good morning said albert your punctuality really alarms me
test1959,you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was half past
test1960,"no, no, my dear fellow, do not confound our plans."
test1961,yes he has not much to complain of borch is the capital of charles the seventh
test1962,it is for that reason you see me so early
test1963,i returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep but my head ached and i got up to have a ride for an hour
test1964,pests i will do nothing of the kind the moment they come from government you would find them insufferable
test1965,besides that does not concern the home but the financial department
test1966,about what about the papers
test1967,in the entire political world of which you are one of the leaders
test1968,they say that it is quite fair and that sowing so much red you ought to reap a little blue
test1969,come come that is not bad said lucia
test1970,with your talents you would make your fortune in three or four years.
test1971,the gentleman had not needed to sit down to become interested apparently he had taken up the volume from a table as soon as he came in and standing there after a single glance around the apartment had lost himself in its pages
test1972,that has an unfaltering sound for me said the young man
test1973,she is willing to risk that
test1974,just as i am the visitor inquired presenting himself with rather a workman's aspect
test1975,he was tall and lean and dressed throughout in black his shirt color was low and wide and the triangle of linen a little crumpled exhibited by the opening of his waistcoat was adorned by a pin containing a small red stone
test1976,in spite of this decoration the young man looked poor it is as poor as a young man could look who had such a fine head and such magnificent eyes
test1977,those of basil ransom were dark deep and glowing his head had a character of elevation which fairly added to his statue it was a head to be seen above the level of the crowd on some judicial bench or political platform or even on a bronze medal
test1978,these things the eyes especially with their smoldering fire might have indicated that he was to be a great american statesman or on the other hand they might simply have proven that he came from carolina or alabama
test1979,and yet the reader who likes a complete image who desires to read with the senses as well as with the reason is entreated not to forget that he prolonged his consonants and swallowed his vowels that he was guilty of elision and interjections which were equally unexpected and that his discourse was pervaded by something sullen and vast something almost african in its rich basking tone
test1980,and he took up his hat vaguely a soft black hat with a low crown and an immense straight brim
test1981,well so it is they are all witches and wizards mediums and spirit rappers and roaring radicals
test1982,if you are going to dine with her you had better know it oh murder
test1983,he looked at missus luna with intelligent incredulity
test1984,she was attractive and impertinent especially the latter
test1985,have you been in europe
test1986,no i haven't been anywhere
test1987,she hates it she would like to abolish it
test1988,this last remark he made at anventure for he had naturally not devoted his suspicion whatever to missus lina
test1989,are you very ambitious you look like you wear
test1990,and missus luna added that now she was back she didn't know what she should do
test1991,one didn't even know what one had come for
test1992,besides oliver didn't want her in boston and didn't go through the form of saying so
test1993,that was one comfort with livia she never went through any forms
test1994,she stood there looking consciously and rather seriously and missed a ransom a smile of exceeding faintness played about her lips it was just perceptible to light up the native gravity of her face
test1995,her voice was low and agreeable a cultivated voice and she extended a slender white hand to her visitor her remark with some solemnity he felt a certain guilt of participation in missus lune's in discretion that he was intensely happy to make her acquaintance
test1996,he observed that miss chancellor's hand was at once called and limp she merely placed it in his without exerting the smallest pressure
test1997,i shall be back very late we are going to a theater party that's why we dine so early
test1998,missus luna's familiarity extended even to her sister she remarked to miss chancelle that she looked as if she got up for a sea voyage
test1999,paul ransom announced this fact to himself as if he had made a great discovery but in reality he had never been so beauchamp as at that moment
test2000,the women he had hitherto known had been mainly of his own soft climb and it was not often they exhibited the tendency he detected and curiously deplored in missus lunsford's sister
test2001,ransom was pleased with the vision of that remedy it must be repeated that he was very provincial
test2002,he was sorry for her but he saw in a flash that no one could help her that was what made her tragic
test2003,she could not defend herself against a rich admiration a kind of tenderness of envy of anyone who had been so happy as to have that opportunity
test2004,his family was ruined they had lost their slaves their property their friends and relations their home had tasted of all the cruelty of defeat
test2005,the state of mississippi seemed to him the state of despair so he surrendered the remnants of his patrimony to his mother and sisters and at nearly thirty years of age alighted for the first time in new york in the costume of his province with fifty dollars in his pocket and a gnawing hunger in his heart
test2006,it was in the female line as bale's ransom had written in answering her letter with a good deal of form and flourish he spoke as if they had been royal houses
test2007,if it had been possible to send missus ransom money or even clothes she would have liked that but she had no means of assuring how such an offering would be taken
test2008,olivia had a fear of everything but her greatest fear was of being afraid
test2009,she had erected it into a sort of rule of conduct that whenever she saw a risk she was to take it and she had frequently humiliations at finding her self safe after all
test2010,she was perfectly safe after writing to bazel's ransom and indeed it was difficult to see what he could have done to her except thank her he was only exceptionally suppliant for her letter and assure her that he would come and see her the first time his business he was beginning to get a little should take him to boston
test2011,he was too simple too mississippi for that she was almost disappointed
test2012,of all things in the world contention was most sweet to her the why it is hard to imagine who had always caused her tears headaches a day or two in bed an acute emotion and it was very possible bazeley's ransom would not care to contend
test2013,miss chancellor himself has thought so much on the vital subject would she not give a few more remarks and give them some of her experiences
test2014,how did the ladies in beaconsfield feel about the ballot
test2015,perhaps you could speak for them more than for some others
test2016,with her immense sympathy for reform she found herself so often wishing that reformers were a little different
test2017,olivia had hated to hear that fair avenue talked about as if it was such a remarkable place and to live there were a proof of wondrous glory
test2018,all sorts of inferior people lived there and so brilliant a woman as missus funderdore who lived at brooksbury not to mix things up
test2019,she knew her place in the boston hierarchy and it was not what missus farrington supposed that there was a want of perspective in talking to her as if she had been a representative of the aristocracy
test2020,she wished to walk in another field she had long been troubled with the romance of the people
test2021,this might seem one of the most accessible of pleasures but in point of fact she had not found it so
test2022,charlie was a young man in a white overcoat and a paper collar it was for him in the last analysis that they cared much the most
test2023,oliver of course wondered how missus fender would treat her branch of the question
test2024,if it have been necessary we are prepared to take certain steps to consolidate the shrinking
test2025,our movement is for all it is also the most delicate ladies
test2026,rise the standard among them and bring me your thousand names
test2027,a look after the details as well as the booklets missus farren added in a tone as explanatory as could be expected of such a woman and with a smile of which the sweetness was thrilling to her listener
test2028,said old chancellor with a face which seemed to plead for a remission of his responsibility
test2029,i want to be near to them to help them
test2030,it was one thing to choose for herself but now the great representative of the enfranchisement of their sex from every form of bondage had chosen for her
test2031,the unhappiness of women
test2032,they were her sisters they were her own and the day of their delivery had dawned
test2033,this was the only sacred cause this was with the great the dust revolution it was triumph it was sweep everything before it it must exact from the other the brutal blood stained ravaging race the last particle of expiation
test2034,there would be names of women weak insulted persecuted but devoted in every part of their being to the cause and asking no better fate than to die for it
test2035,it was not clear to this interesting girl in what manner such a sacrifice at this last would be required of her that she solved a matter through a kind of sunless mist of emotion which made danger as rosey's success
test2036,when miss bird's eye approached it transfigured her familiar her comical shape and made the poor little humanitarian hack seem already a martyr
test2037,olivia chancellor looked at her with love remembered that she had never in her long and rewarded weary life had a thought on an impulse for herself
test2038,she had been consumed by the passion of sympathy it had crumpled her into as many creases as an old glazed distended glove
test2039,"but excuse me, didn't you figure on doing some detecting and giving up fishing?"
test2040,and shag with the freedom of an old servant stood looking at his master as if not quite understanding the new twist the affairs had taken
test2041,i'm going off fishing i may not catch anything and i may not want to after i get there.
test2042,get ready shag yes sir colonel
test2043,and having put himself in a fair way as he had hoped to solve some of the problems connected with the darcy case colonel ashley went down to the police headquarters to learn more facts in the connection with the murder of the east indian
test2044,"pincus and donovan, haven't they, yeah?"
test2045,carl was too much engaged in watching the blue smoke curl lazily upward from his cigar just then to say more
test2046,"are you going to work on that case, counselor?"
test2047,"but he hadn't any more to do with it, colonel, that cat."
test2048,"perhaps not admitted, colonel ashley."
test2049,we've got our man and that's all we want.
test2050,"you're on the arse case, they tell me in a way, yes."
test2051,"i'm working in the interest of the young men,"
test2052,it's just one of them coincidences like
test2053,busted his head in with a heavy candlestick one of a pair
test2054,"gad, explained the colonel."
test2055,the very pair i was going to buy.
test2056,"look here, colonel do you know anything about this?"
test2057,and the detective's professional instincts got the upper hand of his friendliness not the least in the world not as much as you do was the cool answer
test2058,i happened to see those candlesticks in the window of singleft's shop the other day and i might have my mind to buy them when i had a chance
test2059,now i'm afraid i won't but how did it happen
test2060,"thou i don't know whether it's his first or his last name, anyhow he had a partner named shirley lee."
test2061,anyhow he and fitch didn't get along very well it seems.
test2062,neighbours often heard them scraping a lot and this afternoon they went at it again hot and heavy
test2063,to dark a man went in to buy a lamp
test2064,he found the place without a light in it it stumbled over something on the floor and there was allie's body with the head busted in and this heavy candlestick near it
test2065,sure held so tight it could hardly get it out
test2066,maybe the fight was about who owned the watch for the dagos talked in their foreign language and none of the neighbors could tell what they were saying i see
test2067,and the watch have you it yes it's here.
test2068,"that's the watch, announced the headquarters detective, reaching in for it, going it, see."
test2069,"you're not as screaming as all that, are you? just because it was in a dead man's hands and a woman's."
test2070,dolphin's voice was plainly skeptical.
test2071,"yes, it may have some rough edges on it."
test2072,and i've read enough about germs to know the danger i'd advise you to be careful
test2073,if you don't mind i should like to examine this a bit.
test2074,"before the big wind in ireland suggested thong, with the nod of his israelite companion, slightly, he'll have the colonel."
test2075,that's right agreed the colonel as he continued to move his magnifying glass over the surface of the still ticking watch
test2076,and a close observer might have observed that he did not touch his bare fingers to the time piece but poked it about and touched it here and there with the end of a lead pencil
test2077,and donovan take a friend's advice and don't be too free with that watch too free with it.
test2078,"yes, asked the surprise detective yes."
test2079,don't scratch yourself on whatever you do why not
test2080,"simply because this watch,"
test2081,someone out here to see you
test2082,"all right, i'll be there in a second."
test2083,shing-fu was the painting answer.
test2084,i want to talk over darcy's case with you the colonel had said and the two had talked had thought had talked again and now we were silent for a time
test2085,what are the chances of getting him off legally if we go at it from a negative standpoint asked the colonel.
test2086,rather a hypothetical question colonel but i should say it might be a fifty fifty proposal
test2087,at best he would get off with the scottish verdict of not proven but he doesn't want that nor do i
test2088,and you i don't want it either.
test2089,but i want to know just where we stand now i know
test2090,but i need to do a little more smoking out first now i wanted to think
test2091,if you excuse me i'll pretend i'm fishing and i may catch something
test2092,in fact i have a feeling that i shall land my fish.
test2093,i'd recommend him to you instead of blackstone thanks slapped henry.
test2094,what is it perhaps i can help you?
test2095,"the old adage of two heads, you know."
test2096,"yes, it still holds good."
test2097,"no alimony, replied the colonel puzzled yes just that."
test2098,and there's no reason you shouldn't know.
test2099,chuckled the colonel as he skillfully played the luckless trout now struggling to get loose from the hook
test2100,and when the fish was landed panting on the grass and shag had been roused from his slumber to slip the now limp fish into the creek captain ashley gave a sigh of relief and remarked i think i see it now
test2101,the reason she asked no alimony inquired kenneth.
test2102,no i wasn't thinking of that
test2103,however don't think i'm not interested in your case i've finished enough for to day
test2104,"well, i don't know that you can."
test2105,"it isn't generally known when on the lawyer that the hotel keeper's wife has left him,"
test2106,it was one of what at first might be called refined cruelty on her husband's part degenerating gradually into that of a base sort
test2107,you don't know that large struck her that there was physical abuse do you asked the colonel that's what he did
test2108,the colonel did not disclose the fact that it was no news to him.
test2109,arthur graffton's statement was being unexpectedly confirmed.
test2110,he remembered that christine and griffith had once been in love with each other.
test2111,she said he had struck her more than once and she could stand it no longer.
test2112,because larch made no defense
test2113,"larch, by refusing to appear practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation."
test2114,so i had to let her have her way and we did not ask the court for money though i had no such squeamish feelings when it came to my counsel fee
test2115,no but he will or i'll sue him and get him judgment oh he'll pay all right
test2116,and it takes all sorts of people to make it up.
test2117,"still i would like to know,"
test2118,the murder of missus darsie had some time been shifted off the front page though it would get back there when the young jueler was tried.
test2119,"it had a double reputation, so to speak."
test2120,grave and even reverent the conventions assembled in its ballroom and politicians of the upper if not better class were frequently seen in its dining room or café
test2121,"large himself was a peculiar character,"
test2122,in a smaller place he would have been called a saloon-keeper.
test2123,and it was this man rich he had said handsome certainly that christina rachel had married
test2124,to this was the answer whispered money
test2125,and in a way it was true.
test2126,she also saw an opportunity of paying old debts and reaping some revenges
test2127,after the marriage which was a brilliant and gay if not happy the large hotel it could hardly be called a home became the scene of many festivities
test2128,then it was said of large that soon after the echoes of the wedding chimes had died away he had begun to treat his wife with refined cruelty that hidden away from the public under his habitual manner there was the rawness of the brute
test2129,but it was noticed that the older and more conservative families were less often represented and when they were it was by some of the younger members whose reputations were already smeared who had not yet acquired any and were willing to take a chance
test2130,it wouldn't do you know after that story came out for me and the vice chancellor who sat in the case as well as other judges and members of the bar to be seen there kathen explained to the colonel
test2131,meanwhile colonel ashley was a very busy man and to no one did he tell much about his activities he saw darcy frequently at the jail and to that young man's pleas that something should be done always returned the answer
test2132,don't worry it will come out right.
test2133,i'm going to rectify them but it will take time.
test2134,"it's hard for miss mason too, although she's bearing up like a major."
test2135,"so king god bail, who put it up,"
test2136,it was high large
test2137,they took harry away while ago.
test2138,but his is pretty uncertain to be in just the same.
test2139,only that i darcy hesitated and grew red
test2140,"good evening, colonel, he called genially will you join me in a welsh rabbit?"
test2141,"thank you, no."
test2142,i'm afraid my digestion isn't quite up to that as i've had to cut out my fishing of late.
test2143,now as to certain matters in the store on the morning of the murder
test2144,the stopped clocks for instance have you any theory
test2145,there were three of them the center figure being that of harry king and he was very much intoxicated
test2146,that is not always but sometimes it happened to be so now
test2147,i beg your pardon he said in the cultured tones he knows so well how to use yet of which he made so little use of late
test2148,i said where have you been remarked the other we've missed you
test2149,i said i was golfing he went on exceedingly distinctly though with an effort
test2150,"why polio, someone asked."
test2151,because your dear friend replied king softly he somewhat resembles a certain person here who talks too much but who is not so wise as he thinks
test2152,there was a rattle of coins on the mahogany bar as king sought to disentangle a single bill from the wetted currency in his pocket.
test2153,it's it's an old coin an old roman one that missus darcy had in her private collection kept in the jewelry store safe was the whispered answer
test2154,i went over them the next day and noticed some were missing though i saw them all when i paid a visit to her just a short time before she was killed
test2155,"that was hers, went on the jore."
test2156,"now harry king has exclaimed, colonel angelica,"
test2157,even the sun came out pale and watery at dawn
test2158,the colds and dyspepsia of the rainy months vanished
test2159,asked worker last sunday you did it when the youngers
test2160,well didn't they shoot us one man exhibited his arm in a sling
test2161,haven't i got something to remember them by the devils
test2162,who are you to destroy the legal government who is lenin a german
test2163,who are you a counter revolutionary a provocator they beloved it at him
test2164,you call yourself the people of russia but you are not the people of russia
test2165,the peasants are the people of russia wait until the peasants
test2166,we know what the prisoners will say aren't they a working man like ourselves
test2167,this man has specially welcomed the call to a congress of pensioners
test2168,this last were the young generation who had been serving in the army
test2169,"whereupon the old executive committee left the hall,"
test2170,down with him they shrieked
test2171,fearful tumbled cries down with the bolshevik key
test2172,upon my return i visited smolny no such accusation was made against me there after a brief conversation i left and that's all let anyone present make such an accusation
test2173,meanwhile the question of the status of the executive committee was agitating all minds
test2174,by declaring the assembly extraordinary conference it had been planned to block the re-election of the executive committee
test2175,but this worked both ways the social revolutionary decided that if the congress had no power over the executive committee then the executive committee had no power over the congress
test2176,on the twenty seventh occurred the debate on the land question which revealed the differences between the agrarian program of the bolsheviks and the socialist revolutionaries
test2177,the constituent assembly will not dare to break with the wheel of the people
test2178,followed him lenin listened to now with absorbing intensity
test2179,the first stage was the crushing of autocracy and the crushing of the power of the industrial capitalist and the landowners whose interests are closely related
test2180,the tumors and zeppelins were dropped
test2181,he knew that an agreement with the polonius was being discussed but he did not know that it had been concluded
test2182,he spoke to the rum convention
test2183,the villages will save us in the end
test2184,but the present movement is international and that is why it is invincible
test2185,the wheel of millions of workers is now concentrated in the hall
test2186,a new humanity will be born of this war
test2187,i greet you with the christening of a new russian life and freedom.
test2188,then i took up a great stone from among the trees and coming up to him smote him therewith on the head with all my might and crushed in his skull as he lay dead drunk
test2189,behold a ship was making for the island through the dashing and clashing waves
test2190,hearing this i was so troubled remembering what i had before suffered from the ape kind
test2191,upon this he bought me a cotton bag and gave it to me he said take this bag and fill it with pebbles from the beach and go forth with the company of the town folk to whom i will give a charge respecting you
test2192,do as they do and be like thou shalt gain what may further thy return voyage to thy native land
test2193,then he carried me to the beach where i filled my bag with pebbles large and small and presently we saw a company of folk issue from the town each bearing a bag like mine filled with pebbles
test2194,to these he committed me commending me to their care and saying this man is a stranger so take him with you and teach him how to gather that you may get his daily bread and you will earn your reward and compensation in heaven
test2195,now sleeping under these trees many eagles which when they saw us rose and fled from us and swarmed up among the branches whereupon my companions began to pelt them with what they had in their bags and the eagles fell to plucking the fruit of the trees and casting them at the folk
test2196,we weighed anchor and zarad perceived to the dawn of the day and ceased saying in her permitted say
test2197,when it was the five hundred and ninety fifth night
test2198,and ceased not to sail until we arrived safely at pusara
test2199,there i abode a little and then went on to baden where i entered my quarter and found my house and for gathered with my family and saluted my friends who gave me joy of my safe return and i laid up all my goods and valuable in my storehouses
test2200,after which i shall return to my old merry way of life and forgot all i had suffered in the great profit and gain i had made
test2201,next morning as soon as it was light he prayed the dawn prayer and after blessing mohammed the cream of all creatures he took himself to the house of sinbad the seaman and wished him a good day
test2202,here i found a great ship ready for sea and full of merchants and notables who had with them goods of price so i embarked my bales there in
test2203,happily among you is one righteous whose prayers the lord will accept
test2204,presently the ship struck the mountain and broke up and all and everything on board of her were plunged into the sea
test2205,but it burns in their bellies so they cast it up again and it congeals on the surface of the water where its color and quantities are changed and at last the waves cast it ashore and the travelers and merchants who know it collected and sold it
test2206,each that died we washed and shrouded in some of the clothes and linen cast ashore by the tides and after little the rest of my fellows perished one by one till i had had the last of the party and a boat alone on the island with but a little provision left i who was want to have so much
test2207,but there is majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great
test2208,when it was the five hundred and sixty first night
test2209,then signing for myself i set to work collecting a number of pieces of chinese and cornish alewood and i bound them together with ropes from the wreckage then i chose out from the broken up ship straight planks of even size and fixed them firmly upon the alewood making me a boat raft a little narrower than the channel of the stream and i tied it tightly and firmly as though they were nailed
test2210,land after land shall thou see confined but no other life on thy wish shall wait fret not thy soul on thy thoughts a night all woes shall end or sooner or later
test2211,i rode my conveyance into the place which was intensely dark and the current carried the raft with it down the underground channel
test2212,and i threw myself down upon my face on the raft by reason of the narrowness of the channel while the stream ceased not to carry me along knowing not night from day for the excess of the gloom which encompassed me about and my terror and concern for myself lest i should perish
test2213,when i awoke at last i found myself in the light of heaven and opening my eyes i saw myself in a broad stream and the raft moored to an island in the midst of a number of indians and aboriginals
test2214,but i was delighted at my escape from the river
test2215,when they saw i understood them not and made them no answer one of them came forward and said to me in arabic peace be with you oh my brother
test2216,oh my brother answered he we are husbandmen and tillers of the soil who came out to water our fields and finding you asleep on this raft held it over of you and made it fast by us against thou shouldst awake at thy leisure
test2217,i answered for allah's sake oh my lord ere i speak give me somewhat to eat for i am starving and after ask me what thou wilt
test2218,when it was the four hundred and sixty second night
test2219,she said it hath reached me an auspicious king that sinbad the sailor continued when i landed and found myself among the indians and abasinians and had taken some rest they consulted among themselves and said to one another there is no help for it but we carry him with us and present him to our king that he may acquaint him with his adventures
test2220,so i consorted with the chief of the islanders and they paid me the utmost respect
test2221,so i rose without stay or delay and kissed the king's hand and acquainted him with my longing to set out with the merchants for that i pined after my people and my own land
test2222,quoth he thou art thy own master yet if it be thy will to abide with us on her head and eyes be it for thou art gladdest with thy company
test2223,by allah are my lord answered i thou hast indeed overwhelmed me with thy favors and well doings but i weary for a sight of my friends and family native country
test2224,then i took leave of him and of all my intimates and acquaintances in the island and embarked with the merchant asaf said
test2225,he asked me when they came and i said to him by alah a commander of the faithful i know not the name of the city nor the way to it
test2226,for state proceedings a throne is set for him upon a huge elephant eleven cubits high and upon this he sits having his great lords and officers and guests standing in two ranks on his right hand and on his left
test2227,his letter hath shown me this and as for the mightiness of his dominion that hath told us what there hath been witnessed
test2228,presently my friends came to me and i distributed presence among my family and gave arms and large s after which i yielded myself to joints and enjoyment mirth and merry making and forgot all that i had suffered
test2229,such as oh my brothers is the history of what befell me in my sixth voyage and tomorrow inshallah
test2230,i will tell you the story of my seventh and last voyage which is still more wondrous and marvelous than that of the first six
test2231,when it was the five hundred and sixty third night
test2232,she said it hath reached me an auspicious king when sinbad the seamen had related the history of what befell him in his sixth voyage and all the company had dispersed sinbad the landman went home and slept as a want
test2233,the seventh voyage of sinbad the sailor
test2234,no oh company that after my return from my sixth voyage which brought me abundant profit i resumed my former life in all possible joints and enjoyment and mirth and making merry day and night and i tarried some time in this solace and satisfaction till my soul began once more to long to sail the seas and see foreign countries and company with merchants and hear new things
test2235,so having made up my mind i packed up in bales a quantity of precious stuffs suited for sea trade and repaired with them from badgat city to basra town where i found a ship ready for sea and in her a company of considerable merchants
test2236,but the captain arose and tightening his girdle tucked up his skirts and after taking refuge with all from satan the stoned climbed to the masthead when he looked out right and left and gazed at the passengers and crew failed to buffeting in his face and plucking out his beard
test2237,this he sat in a sower wetted with a little water and after waiting a short time smelt and tasted it and then he took out of the chest a booklet where he read a while and said weeping no oh ye passengers that in this book is a marvelous matter noting that whomsoever come thither shall surely die without hope of escape for that this ocean is called the sea of the climb of the king where in is a sepal of our lord
test2238,a second fish read its appearance and which we had seen not more monstrous
test2239,when suddenly a violent squall of wind rose and smote the ship which rose out of the water and settled upon a great reef the howl of sea monsters where it broke up and fell under a plank and all and everything on board were plunged into the sea
test2240,unfortunately there could be no doubt or misconception as the platter's guilt
test2241,he had not only plied guilty but had expressed his intention of repeating his escape in other directions as soon as circumstances permitted throughout the trial he was busy examining a small model of the free trade hall in manchester
test2242,the jury could not possibly find that the prisoner had not deliberately and intentionally blown up the albert hall the question was could they find any extenuating circumstances which would permit of an acquittal
test2243,of course any sentence which the law may feel compelled to inflict would be followed by an immediate pardon but it was highly desirable from the government's point of view that the necessity for such an exercise of clemency should not arise
test2244,a long pardon on the eve of a by election with threats of a heavy voting deficiency if they were withheld or even delayed would not necessarily be a surrender but it would look like one
test2245,hence the anxiety in the crowded court and in the little groups gathered round the tape machines in white hall and downing street and other affected centers
test2246,the jury returned from considering their verdict there was a flutter an excited murmur a death like hush
test2247,the foreman delivered his message
test2248,the jury find a prisoner guilty of blowing up the albert hall
test2249,the jury wished to add a writer drawing attention to the fact that a by election is spending in the parliamentary division of nemesis on hand
test2250,and may the lord have mercy on the poll a junior counsel exclaimed irrevently
test2251, fifteen hundred said a prime minister with a shudder it's too horrible to think of
test2252,our majority last time was only a thousand and seven
test2253,seven thirty amended the prime minister we must avoid any appearance of precipitancy
test2254,not later than seven thirty then said the chief organizer i have promised the agent down there that he shall be able to display posters announcing platterbauf is out before the poll opens
test2255,he said it was our only chance of getting a telegram red tape in to night
test2256,despite the earlyness of the hour a small crowd had gathered in the street outside and the horrible menacing three lone refrain of the fifteen hundred voting men came in a steady monotonous chant
test2257,he exclaimed won't go
test2258,he says he has never left prison without a breast band to play him out and he's not going to go without one now
test2259,said the prime minister we can hardly be supposed to supply an early released prisoner with a brass band how on earth could we defend it on the estimates
test2260,any way you won't unless he has a pant
test2261,paul opens in five minutes
test2262,splatter off yet
test2263,in heaven's name why
test2264,the chief administrator ran off
test2265,this is not a moment for standing indignity he observed bluntly musicians must be supplied at once
test2266,can't you get a strike permit as the organizer
test2267,i'll try said the home secretary and went to the telephone
test2268,eight o'clock struck the crowd outside chanted with an increasing volume of sound will vote the other way
test2269,a telegram brought in
test2270,it was from the central committee rooms at nemesis
test2271,without a band he would not go and they had no band
test2272,a quarter past ten half past
test2273,have you any band instruments of an easy nature to play
test2274,demanded the chief organizer of the prison governor drums symbols those sort of things
test2275,though warders have a private band of their own said the governor but of course i couldn't allow the men themselves
test2276,lends us the instruments said a chief organizer
test2277,the popular song of the moment replied the agitator after a moment's reflection
test2278,it was a tune they had all heard hundreds of times so there was no difficulty in turning out a passable imitation of it to the improvised trains of i didn't want to do it the prisoners threw forth to freedom
test2279,the word of the song had reference it was understood to the incarcerating government and not to the destruction of the albert hall
test2280,this seat was lost after all by a narrow maturity
test2281,the local trade unionists took offense at the fact of cabinet ministers having personally acted as strike breakers and even the release of platterbauf failed to pacify them
test2282,with that notorious failing of his he was not the sort of person one wanted in one's house
test2283,well the failing still exists doesn't it said the husband or do you suppose a reform of characters is entailed along with the state
test2284,besides cynical part his being rich will make a difference in the way people will look at his failing
test2285,when a man is absolutely wealthy not merely well to do all suspicion of sorted motive naturally disappears the thing becomes merely a tiresome melody
test2286,wilfred pigeon coat had suddenly become air to his uncle sir wilfred pigeon coat on the death of his cousin major wilfred pigeon coat who had succumbed to the after effects of apollo's accident
test2287,a wilfred pheasant coat had covered himself with honors in the course of malborough's campaigns and the name lord wilfred had been about a pitiful weakness in the family every since the new ear to the family dignity and estates was a young man of about five and twenty who was known more by reputation than by person to a wide circle of cousins and kinfolk
test2288,and the reputation was an unpleasant one
test2289,from his late school days onward he had been possessed by an acute and obstinate form of claustrophobia he had the acquired instinct of the collector without any of the collector's discrimination
test2290,the search usually produced a large and varied yield this is funny said peter penguin to his wife some half an hour after their conversation here is a telegram from wilfred saying he's passing through here in his motor and would like to stop and pay as his respects
test2291,sign'd william peechin's coat.
test2292,i suppose he is bringing us a present for the silver wedding good gracious
test2293,the talk flitted nervously and hastily from one personal topic to another
test2294,in the drawing room after dinner their nervousness and awkwardness increased
test2295,oh we haven't shown you the silver wedding presents said missus peter suddenly as those struck by a brilliant idea for entertaining the guest here they all are
test2296,such nice useful gifts a few duplicates of course
test2297,seven cream jugs put in peter
test2298,we feel that we must live on cream for the rest of our lives
test2299,of course some of them can be changed
test2300,i put it down by the clarinet jug said wilfred busy with another object
test2301,violence was not completely crowned with a sense of victory
test2302,after they had said good night to their visitor missus peter expressed her conviction that he had taken something
test2303,how on earth are we to know said peter the mean pig hasn't brought us a present and i'm hung if he shall carry one off
test2304,it's the only thing to do.
test2305,willard was late in coming down to breakfast and his manner showed plainly that something was amiss
test2306,it's an unpleasant thing to have to say he blurted out presently but i'm afraid you must have a thief among your servants something's been taken out of my portmanteau
test2307,it was a little present from my mother and myself for your silver wedding
test2308,i should have given it to you last night after dinner only it happened to be a green jug and you seemed annoyed at having so many duplicates so i felt rather awkward about giving you another
test2309,the snatcher had been an orphan this many years
test2310,lady ernestine peacock his mother moved in circles which were entirely beyond their compass or ambitions and the son would probably one day be an ambassador
test2311,husband and wife looked blankly and desperately at one another
test2312,it was missus peter who arrived first at an inspiration how dreadful to think there are thieves in the house we gave a drawing room locked up at night of course but anything might be carried off while we are at breakfast
test2313,she rose and went out hastily as though to assure herself that the drawing room was not being stripped of its silverware and returned a moment later bearing a cream jug in her hands
test2314,the pheasant coats had turned pale than ever missus peter had a final inspiration
test2315,peter dashed out of the room with glad relief he had lived so long during the last few minutes that a golden wedding seemed within measurable distance
test2316,missus peter turned to her guest with confident coinage
test2317,peter's little weakness it transpires in the family good lord
test2318,do you mean to say he is an ectoplasmic like cousin snatcher
test2319,brave little woman said bitter with a gasp of relief i could never have done it
test2320,i'm from the cutter lying off the coast
test2321,don't cry he said i was obliged to come
test2322,and and you have not found out anything came in frightened tones
test2323,i wish you would believe me that i am in great trouble about it you
test2324,that my father sir ronald graham has smuggled goods here
test2325,he could not help it he hates the smugglers you shall not tell
test2326,pray pray you shall not archi is silent
test2327,then as archie stood in the dark literally aghast with astonishment he heard the faint rustling once more and again all was silent
test2328,he laughed but it was a curious kind of laugh full of vexation injured love proper as the prince callour of our own love of our own dignity of which archibald raystroke in the full flush of his young life in his importance as a british officer had a pretty good stock
test2329,and all comes of dressing up in this stupid way like a rough fisher lad
test2330,cold water came on this idea directly as he recalled the fact that the darkness was intense and siela could not have seen him
test2331,i'll soon show them that i am not going to be played with
test2332,for it suddenly occurred to him that he was not only a prisoner but a prisoner in the power of a very reckless set of people who would stop it nothing
test2333,no he thought to himself i don't believe they would kill me but they would knock me about
test2334,the kick he had received was a foretaste of what he might expect and after a little consideration he came to the conclusion that his duty was to escape and get back to the cutter as quickly as he could
test2335,to do this he must scheme lie hid till morning then make for the nearest point and signal for help unless a boat's crew were already searching for him how to escape
test2336,the window was barred but he went to it and tried the bars one by one to find them all solidly fitted into the stone sill
test2337,next moment as he felt his way away his hand touched an old fashioned marble mantle piece fireplace chimney
test2338,yes if otherwise he could escape up the chimney
test2339,no that was too bad he couldn't do that
test2340,sympathy and pity for the dwellers in the hovs were completely gone now and he said his teeth fast and mentally called himself a weak idiot for ever thinking about such people
test2341,a narrow table between the wall and two places
test2342,he went and tried to force his head through recalling as he did where that a person's head would go the rest of the body would pass
test2343,but there was no chance for his body at the head it would not go first
test2344,a fellow who was shut up in prison for life might do it he said but not in a case like this
test2345,sure you've looked round everywhere boy yes father quite
test2346,i'm going home for breakfast
test2347,shall i come to father no
test2348,stop here till sir riddle comes down and tell him i'm very sorry that we should have cleared out last night only a born fool saw jerry and andy's lobsterboat coming into the cove and ran in to say it was a party from the cutter yes father
test2349,tell him not to be uneasy it's all right and i'll have everything clear tonight
test2350,the dull sound of departing steps and a low whistling sound coming down through the sky light window into the chamber where archer strode lay with his heavy eyes pressed down by sleep
test2351,what a queer dream he thought to himself
test2352,but how queer for mister to be talking like that to andrew teal the boy who helped the cook
test2353,and why did andy call mister father
test2354,there was an interval of thinking over this naughty question during which the whisper went on
test2355,and i'm hungry too time i was i suppose
test2356,no he was not dreaming for he was looking out on the sea which over which a faint mist hung like ridges of smoke
test2357,what did they say false alarm tell servants they would clear all away tonight see if anything had been left about lobster boat
test2358,once out of that room he could run and by day light the smugglers dare not hunt him down
test2359,oh those bars he mentally exclaimed and he was advancing towards them well just as he drew near there was a rustling noise under the window a couple of hands seized the bars there was a scratching of boots against stone work and ram's face appeared to gaze into the room by intention but into the astonished countenance of the young midwife instead
test2360,ren was the first to recover from his surprise
test2361,hello he said who are you
test2362,go round and open the door i was shut in last night by mistake
test2363,i saw you last night and wondered who he was
test2364,it was you father kicked for shirking and may well i hardly knew you
test2365,nonsense
test2366,won't do sitting around grinning
test2367,i don't know you don't know mister orfman
test2368,"won't do, said reed quickly i know you"
test2369,been playing the spy that's what you've been doing who locked you in
test2370,arcturus stepped back to the door listening but there was not a sound
test2371,he has gone to give the alarm thought the prisoner and he looked excitedly for an escape
test2372,nothing but the chimney presented itself
test2373,a happy inspiration came and placing one hand upon his chest he thrust in the other gave a tug and drew out his little curved dirt glanced at the edge ran at the window and began at one at the bars labor in vain
test2374,he divided the paint and produced a few squeaks and grating sounds as he realized that the attempt was madness
test2375,the result was not very satisfactory but sufficiently so to make him essay the bar of the window once more producing a grading era selling sound as he found that now he did make a little impression so little though that the probability was if he kept on working well for twenty four hours he would not get through
test2376,but at the end of five minutes he stopped and thrust back the dirt into its sheath
test2377,no i can't part with that ha ha ha left the boys laughing
test2378,but i'll yes i'll give you a gini if you let me out
test2379,ginny's the boy think i'll do it for her ginny well then

test2385,not you look like a wild beast in a cage like a monkey you insolent
test2386,archie checked himself and the boy laughed
test2387,it was your turn yesterday it's mine today what a game
test2388,you laughed and flared at me when i was on the cutters deck
test2389,i say you do look like a roman just like a big monster in a show

test2391,you ropes he said
test2392,why i could tie you up in a noose and heave you off the cliff any day what a game
test2393,a bit of a middy on a salt tack and weevil biscuit talk of giving me ropes end
test2394,once more will you come and let me out no
test2395,to his astonishment the board did not flinch but thrust his own arms through them placing them about the middy's waist clutching his hand behind and uttering a sharp whistle
test2396,"seemed good spirits last night, mister gur, hey."
test2397,yes sir but he may turn up on the cliff at any moment
test2398,yes men quite ready yes sir
test2399,that's right of course well alarmed

test2402,so let us say yes
test2403,you don't think mister gurd that they would dare to injure him if he was so unlucky as to be caught
test2404,well said the master hesitating smugglers or smugglers

test2406,"begone, sir didn't mean any harm"
test2407,"i'm getting very anxious about mister racebrook start at once, sir."

test2414,i mean all alone by myself sir
test2415,but four aren't there a public for ten miles didn't mean that
test2416,"then what did you mean speak out and don't do the double shuffling over my clean deck no, sir."
test2417,hopping about like a kid on hot bricks
test2418,now why do you want to go ashore
test2419,"begone! didn't mean it now, sir, said the attaching his forelock."
test2420,yes said sir by the mandarin shall i go at once sir
test2421,"now wait,"
test2422,keep a sharp eye on it at the cliff to see if mr. rae's stroke is sending signals for a boat
test2423,he swam round walked off and began sweeping the shore again with his glass while the master and deck exchanged views which made a great deal
test2424,at last the little lieutenant could bear the anxiety no longer
test2425,pip them away into that there boat he said and there as the crew sprang in
test2426,now mister he said i'm only going to say one thing to you in the way of instructions yes sir
test2427,"begone, said the master depreciatingly"

test2430,mr. reynolds sir don't you be a fool

test2440,if she knew evil had come to the poor lady's face she would face tales like print
test2441,i said a lad about seventeen and a red cap like yours said very shortly
test2442,the man shook his head and stared as if he didn't half understand the drift of what was said
test2443,"here, my lad, where's your master?"
test2444,hey i say where's your master
test2445,gur returned away patiently again and signing to his men to follow they began to tramp the steep track leading toward the hoose with the rabbits scuttling away among the furs and showing their white cotton tail for a moment as they darted into their holes
test2446,i don't know under my dick and they can't be sure
test2447,gursel saluted and stated his business while the baron who had turned sailor and more careworn than his own drew a breath of full relief one of your ship boys he said
test2448,al looking like a common sailor and wearing a red cap no said residen
test2449,i've seen no one answering to the description here.
test2450,beg pardon but can you as a gentleman assure me that he is not here certainly said sir is he
test2451,surely cried served and excitedly
test2452,written in exile
test2453,lily grimm looked ghastly
test2454,you do not know no no
test2455,these hatreds were soon to make trouble for me of which i had never dreamed
test2456,henry washington younger my father represented jackson county three times in the legislature and was also a judge of the county court
test2457,my mother who was bereshit fristoh of independence was a daughter of richard fristoh who fought under general andrew jackson in new orleans jackson county having so named at my grandfather fristoh's insistence

test2463,miss washington wells and her son samuel on the home road from kansas city to lewis summit recognize the body as that of my father
test2464,missus stayed to guard the remains while her son carried the news of the murder to captain peabody of the federal command who was then in camp at kansas city
test2465,miss mccorkle jumped from the window of the house and escaped
test2466,as the raiders left one of them shouted
test2467,now old lady call on your protectors why don't you call on co older now
test2468,every not represented a human life
test2469,but she failed to find the comfort she sought for annoyances continued in a more aggravated form
test2470,two months after this incident the same persecutors again entered our home at the day of the night and at the point of a pistol tried to force my mother to set fire to her own home
test2471,i have always felt that the exposure to which she was subjected on this cruel journey too hard even for a man to take was a direct cause of her death
test2472,from hamilton she went to waverly where she was hounded continually
test2473,one of the conditions upon which her life was spared was that she would report lexington weekly
test2474,one of my old school teachers whom i have never seen since the spring or summer of eighteen sixty two is steven b i elkins senator from west virginia
test2475,when i was taken prisoner i expected it to be shot without ceremony
test2476,we took the oath perhaps three hundred of us down from lutheran mason's farm a few miles from where i now write where colonel hayes had encamped after independence
test2477,boomer and myself made coffee and coffee in the rest below hill on grand river
test2478,accordingly i was shortly awakened to accompany him to a loan jack where he would personally make known the situation to the other colonels
test2479,foster had nearly one thousand cavemen and two pieces of raven's indiana battery that had already made for itself a name for hard fighting
test2480,"come in, colonel exclaimed claimed colonel crocker"
test2481,i think he'll be rather tough for breakfast i replied he might be all right for dinner
test2482,jackman with a party of thirty seasoned men charged the indiana guns and captured them but major foster let a galloon charge against the invaders and recaptured the pieces
test2483,we were out of ammunition and helpless had the fight been pressed
test2484,they marked my clothes in one or two places however
test2485,major foster and a letter to judge john and benedict of new york said
test2486,i was told by some of our men from the western border of the state that they recognize a daring young rider as co older
test2487,about nine thirty am i was shot down
test2488,the wounds of both forces were gathered up and were placed in houses
test2489,although every proposition reporting to narrate the lives of the younger brothers has told of the liberty robbery and implied that we had a part in it the younger ones were not suspected at that time nor for a long time afterwards
test2490,it was claimed by people of liberty that they positively recognized among the robbers all shepherd red moccasins and bud pants who had seen service with quentin
test2491,this raid was accompanied by bloodshed judge mcclellan the banker being shot though not fatally
test2492,no warrant was issued for the younger's but subsequent historians have infamously at least accused us of taking part but as i said before there is no truth in the accusation
test2493,june third eighteen seventy one obokov brothers bank at croton and iowa was robbed of forty thousand dollars by seven men in broad daylight
test2494,it was charged that arthur mckay or arce mckay and myself had been participants in the gads hill affair and in the two stage robberies
test2495,the parts of this letter now relevant are as follows
test2496,you may use this letter in your own way
test2497,i will give you this outline and sketch of my wearabouts and actions at the time of certain robberies with which i am charged
test2498,at the time of the galeton bank robbery i was gathering cattle and ellis county texas cattle i bought from pleasant taylor and rector
test2499,this can be proven by both of them also by sheriff brooklynn and fifty other respectable men of that county
test2500,i brought the cattle to kansas at fall and remained in saint clair county until february
test2501,i then went to washington and returned to saint clair county about the first of may
test2502,and went to kansas where our cowherd woodson county at colonel ridges
test2503,during the summer i was either in saint claire jackson or canada but as there was no robbery committed that summer it makes no difference where i was
test2504,i went through independence and from there to ace webs
test2505,there i took dinner and then went to the doctor elliot twain's
test2506,our business there was to see ep west he was not at home but the family will remember that we were there
test2507,we crossed on the bridge stayed in the city all night and the next morning we rode up through the city
test2508,i met several of my friends among them was bob hudson
test2509,we were not on good terms at the time nor have we been for several years
test2510,poor john he has been hunted down and shot like a wild beast and never was a boy more innocent
test2511,doctor lewis was his patient
test2512,there were fifty or hundred persons there who will testify in any court that john and i were there
test2513,hellenick and fickle and wife of greenwood valley were attending the springs at that time and either of them will testify to the above for john and i sat in front of mister smith while he was preaching and was in his company for a few moments together with his wife and mister and miss fickle after the service
test2514,about the last of december eighteen seventy three i arrived in carroll parish louisiana
test2515,i stayed there until the eighth of february eighteen seventy four
test2516,i had not heard of that when i wrote the letter of eighteen seventy four and to correct any misapprehension that might be created by omitting it i will say that at the time i was at niohelle kanada with a drive of cattle which i sold to major rae
test2517,it was immediately following the rock island robbery at airfield iowa that their first appeared a delivered enlistment of some local papers in missouri to connect us with this robbery
test2518,i urged on the boys at what ever happened we should not shoot any one
test2519,when miller and i crossed the bridge the three were on some dry good boxes at the corner near the bank and as soon as they saw us went right into the bank instead of waiting for us to get there
test2520,when we came up i told miller to shut the back door which they had left open in their hurry
test2521,j e s allen whose hardware store was near tried to go into the bank but miller ordered him away and he ran around the corner shouting
test2522,get your guns boys they're robbing the bank
test2523,and i called to him to get inside at the same time firing a pistol shot in the air as a signal to the three boys at the bridge that we had been discovered
test2524,almost at this instant i heard a pistol shot in the bank
test2525,chadwell wells and jim rode up and joined us shouting to the people in the street to get inside and firing their pistols to emphasize their commands
test2526,if any of our soldiers shot him it must have been woods
test2527,meantime the street was getting uncomfortably hot
test2528,every time i saw anyone with a bead on me i would drop off my horse and try to drive the shooter inside but i could not see in any direction
test2529,doctor weiler who had gone up stairs in the hotel shot miller and lay dying in the street
test2530,changing his pistol to his left hand bob ran out and mounted miller's mare
test2531,what kept you so long ass pits
test2532,to the rest of the affair inside the bank i take the account of a northwestern narrator
test2533,where's the money outside the safe bob asked
test2534,the shutters were closed and this caused a bunker in an instance delay that was almost fatal fitch chased him with a bullet
test2535,the first one missed him but the second went through his right shoulder
test2536,that night it started to rain and we wore out our horses
test2537,friday we moved towards waterford and friday night we camped between elias and german lake
test2538,bob shattered elbow requiring frequent attention and that night we only had nine miles and monday monday night and in tuesday we spent in a deserted house close to mankato
test2539,that day a man named dunning discovered us and we took him in prisoner
test2540,finally we administered to him an oath to not betray our whereabouts until we had time to make our escape and he agreed not to
test2541,no sooner however was he released than he made posthaste to mankato to announce our presence and in a few minutes another posse was looking for us
test2542,the whistle on the oil mill blew and we feared that it was a signal that had been agreed upon to alarm the town in case we were observed but we were not molested
test2543,he had to sleep with it on his pillow on my breast jim being also crippled with a wound in his shoulder and we could not get much sleep
test2544,but they soon after got close enough so that one of them broke my walking stick with a shot
test2545,we were in sight of our long slow horses when they cut us off from the animals and our last hope was gone
test2546,sixth step to the front sheriff clippson colonel t. l. vault b. m. rice j. b. bradford j. b. pomeroy and j. s. seversen
test2547,forming in line four paces apart he ordered them to advance rapidly and concentrate the fire of the whole line the instant the robbers were discovered
test2548,make for the horses as i said every man for himself
test2549,there's no use stopping to pick up a companion here but we can't get him through the line just charge him and make it if we can
test2550,i got up as a signal for a charge and we fired one volley
test2551,one of the fellows in the outer line not brave enough himself to join the volunteers who had come in to beat it out was not disposed to believe in the surrender and had his gun leveled on bob in spite of the handkerchief which was waving as a flag of truce
test2552,sheriff glispin of watertown county who was taking bob's pistol from him was also shouting to the fellow
test2553,including those received and in on the way from northfield i had eleven wounds
test2554,and sheriff glispin's order not to shoot was the beginning of the protectorate that minnesota people established over us
test2555,captain merdock
test2556,but marsport had flourished enough to kill it off
test2557,some of mars laws dated from the time when law enforcement had been hampered by lack of men rather than by the type of men
test2558,the stone wall gang numbered perhaps five hundred
test2559,even derelics and failures had to eat there were stories and shops throughout the district which eeked out some kind of a marginal living
test2560,they were safe from protection raccoons there none bothered to come so far out
test2561,the shopkeepers and some of the less unfortunate people there had protested loud enough to reach clear back to earth
test2562,captain merdock was an unknown factor and now was asking for more men
test2563,the pressure was enough to get them for him
test2564,gordon reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out mixed with a vague relief
test2565,i've got a free hand and we're going to run this the way we would on earth
test2566,your job is to protect the citizens here and that means everyone not breaking the laws whether you feel like it or not no graft
test2567,the first man making a shake down will get the same treatment we're going to use on the stone wall boys you'll get double pay here and you can live on it
test2568,he picked out five of the men including gordon you five will come with me
test2569,the rest of you can team up any way you want to night pick any route that's open okay men let's go
test2570,brooks gordon grinned slowly as he swung the stick and mordac's eyes fell on him earth cop
test2571,two years gordon admitted
test2572,for a second gordon cursed himself
test2573,he began wondering about security then
test2574,nobody had tried to get in touch with him
test2575,there was a crude lighting system here put up by the citizens at the front of each building a dim fluorescent bulb glowed when darkness fell they would have nothing else to see by
test2576,moving in two groups of threes at opposite sides of the street they began their beat
test2577,there was no chance to save the citizen who was dying from lack of air
test2578,gordon felt the solid pleasure of the finally turned club in his hands
test2579,gordon's eyes popped at that
test2580,he swallowed the sentiment his own club was moving now
test2581,the other four cops had come in reluctantly
test2582,he brought him to the ground with a single blow across the kidneys
test2583,they rounded up the men of the gang and one of the cops started off.
test2584,to find a phone and call the wagon
test2585,we're not using wagons merdok told them line them up
test2586,if they tried to run they were hit from behind if they stood still they were clubbed carefully
test2587,murdock indicated one who stood with his shoulder shaking and tears running down his cheeks
test2588,the captain's face was as sick as gordon's felt
test2589,i want the name of every man in the gang you can remember he told the man
test2590,colonel they'd kill me i don't know
test2591,murdock took his nod as evidence enough and turned to the wicked tuffs
test2592,if he should turn up dead i'll know you boys are responsible and i'll find you
test2593,tragedy began brewing shortly after doon
test2594,murdock set one of the men to pick up a second squad of six and then a third
test2595,and the third one bruce gordon spotted one of the men who had been beaten before
test2596,get a stretcher and take him wherever he belongs he ordered
test2597,but the captain stirred finally sighing
test2598,now the cops are giving me we're covered gordon
test2599,but the sternwall gang was backing wane
test2600,but it's going to be tough on them
test2601,bruce gordon mister i've got a yellow ticket to security
test2602,marduk blinked he dropped his eyes slowly
test2603,what makes you think wain will be re-elected
test2604,nobody wants him except a gang of crooks and those in power
test2605,ever see a marxist election
test2606,no you're a first-rate he can't lose
test2607,and then hell is going to pop and in this whole planet may be blown wide open
test2608,it fitted with the dire predictions of security and what the spying gordon was going to do according to them
test2609,he was getting even fatter now that he was eating better food from the fair restaurant around the corner
test2610,cost a more but they'd be respectable
test2611,because izzy is always honest according to how he sees it
test2612,but you got earth ideas of the stuff like i had once
test2613,the groups grew more experienced and mordecai was training a new squad every night
test2614,it wasn't exactly legal but nothing was here
test2615,this could lead to abuses as he'd seen on earth
test2616,but there probably wouldn't be time for it if mayor wain was re-elected
test2617,it was night outside and the phosphor bulbs at the corners glowed dimly giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the extemporized precinct house
test2618,it had probably been years since any had dared risk it after the sun went down
test2619,and the slow doubtful respect on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that haleys system was working
test2620,gordon hit the signal switch and the mars speaker let out a shrill whistle
test2621,gun suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere
test2622,you can't do it to me
test2623,i'm reformed i'm going straight.
test2624,you damned cops can't o'neal was blubbering
test2625,one look was enough the work papers had the telltale over thickening of the signature that had shown up on other papers obviously forgeries
test2626,some turned away as gordon and the other cop went to work but most of them weren't squeamish
test2627,when it was over the two picked up their whimpering and captive
test2628,chenking the other cop had been holding the wallet
test2629,must have been making a big contact in something fifty fifty
test2630,there must have been over two thousand credits in the wallet
test2631,when gordon and jenkins came back merdock tossed the money to them split it
test2632,whatever comes to hand governor
test2633,like this social call gordon asked him
test2634,the little man shook his head his ancient eighteen year old face turning sober no
test2635,you owe me some bills governor
test2636,eleven hundred fifty credits
test2637,you didn't pay up your pledge to the captain fund so i had to fill in
test2638,"a thousand interests at ten percent a week standard, right?"
test2639,gordon had heard of the friendly interests charged on the side here but he shook his head wrong as he
test2640,ha! he turned it over and shook his head
test2641,now show me where i signed any agreement saying i'll pay you back
test2642,for a second izzy's face went blank then he chuckled
test2643,he pulled out the bills and handed them over
test2644,thanks izzy thanks yourself
test2645,the kid pocketed the money cheerfully nodding
test2646,the little guy knew mars as few others did apparently from all sides
test2647,and if any of the other others had private racks of their own izzy was undoubtedly the man to find it out and use the information with a beat such as that even going halves and with all the graph to the upper brackets he'd still be able to make his pile in a matter of months
test2648,the captain looked completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped onto the bench
test2649,go on except dam it
test2650,there was a man coming from earth on a second ship who would see him
test2651,the little publisher was back at the crusader again
test2652,only gordon and shelia were left
test2653,credit had been established again and the businesses were open
test2654,gordon came to a row of temporary bubbles individual dwellings built like the dome but opaque for privacy
test2655,they had been lucky
test2656,shulberg's volunteers were official now.
test2657,fats place was still open though the crude tables had been removed gordon dropped to a stool slipping off his helmet
test2658,he reached automatically for the glass of etherealneedled beer
test2659,thought you'd be in the chips
test2660,that's mars gordon echoed the other's comment why don't you take off the planet fats you could go back to earth i'd guess the other nodded
test2661,guess a man gets used to anything hell maybe i can hire some bum to sit around and whip up when the ships come in and bill this is a real old marten den of sin
test2662,there was a grin on the other's face
test2663,finally got out our orders for you it's mercury
test2664,we sent twenty others the same way and they failed
test2665,let say you've shifted some of the misery around a bit and given them a chance to do better
test2666,you can't stay here
test2667,there's a rocket waiting to transship you to the moon on the way to mercury right now gordon side
test2668,and i paid her the pay we owe you from the time you began using your badge she's out shopping
test2669,but his old eyes were glinting
test2670,did you think we'd let you go without seeing you off cabbie he asked
test2671,i i oh drat i'm getting old izzy you tell him
test2672,he grabbed gordon's hand and waded down the landing plank ezra shook his head
test2673,any coxswain who had begun to make reads with lissie
test2674,leisurely determined to try for honors in english language and literature
test2675,her tastes all lay in this direction her idea by and by to follow her mother's profession of journalism for which she already showed considerable aptitude
test2676,she had no idea of allowing herself to break down
test2677,what do you mean replied lily
test2678,why you will be parting from me you know
test2679,i won't be the constant worry and plague of your life
test2680,it is this if by any chance you don't leave eternal words any i hope you will allow me to be your room mate again next year
test2681,sandy a flash of light coming into her eyes and then leaving them
test2682,but she said abruptly you speak of something which must not take place
test2683,i must pass on it if i don't i shall die
test2684,a few moments later they came a tap at the door
test2685,lizzy opened the door
test2686,charnier stood without
test2687,these letters have just come for you and any christians she said and as i was coming upstairs i thought i would leave them with you
test2688,leslie thanked her and eagerly grasped the little parcel
test2689,her eyes shone with pleasure at the anticipation of the delightful time she would have reveling in the home news the other letter was directed to adeline chaston
test2690,here is a letter to annie cried lizzie
test2691,her face grew suddenly white what is a death
test2692,i have been starving or rather i have been thirsting
test2693,well read it in peace said it leisurely i won't disturb you
test2694,i am truly glad it has come
test2695,leslie seated herself with her back to her companion and opened her own letters

test2700,just after midnight she rose with a sigh to prepare for bed
test2701,she looked around the room
test2702,now i remember she sent a letter which upset her very much and went out
test2703,leslie went to the window and flung it open she put her head out and tried to peer into the darkness but the moon had already set and she could not see more than a couple of yards in front of her
test2704,she is a queer erratic creature and that letter there was bad news in that letter
test2705,what can she be doing out by herself?
test2706,thelma left the room but she had scarcely gone a dozen places down the corridor before she met any returning
test2707,annie's eyes were very bright her cheeks were no longer pale and there was a brilliant color in them
test2708,she did not take the least notice of leslie but going into the room shut the door
test2709,don't begin see you

test2721,she got up to bed as she spoke and wrap the clothes tightly round her
test2722,could you manage with a candle just for once
test2723,sincerely citadel live
test2724,she turned off the light and lit a candle which she put behind her screen then prepared to get into bed
test2725,annie's manner was very mysterious
test2726,and he didn't mean to confine any one that night and the kindest thing was to leave her alone
test2727,tired lily herself dropped to sleep
test2728,annie is that you she called out
test2729,there was no reply but the sound of hurrying steps came quicker and quicker now and then they were interrupted by a groan
test2730,oh this will kill me my heart will break this will kill me
test2731,the guild of saint elizabeth
test2732,immediately after dinner that evening leslie ran up to her room to make preparations for her visit to east hall

test2742,leslie was just closing the door behind her when annie called after her

test2750,oh i won't press you replied jane
test2751,oh i shall never do that replied lily

test2763,scarcely likely replied lily she told me she was determined not to come to the meeting
test2764,but marjorie and ellen had already departed and leslie and jane found themselves among the last students to arrive at the great east hall
test2765,miss lordendale was standing with the other teachers and principles of the different halls on a raised platform
test2766,then a rogue call went through by one of the teachers the only absence was any colchester
test2767,the physical part of your training and also the mental part are abundantly supplied in this great house of learning she concluded but the spiritual part it seems to me ought now to be strengthened
test2768,hair hair and again hair
test2769,she uttered a stern mark standing up
test2770,marjorie and aileen were close to her
test2771,i will talk to you with bell achristian presently she said

test2777,all men are your brothers
test2778,for all who sin all who suffer you are to a certain extent responsible
test2779,after the address the girls themselves were encouraged to speak and a very animated discussion followed
test2780,it was ten o'clock when she left the hall
test2781,just as she was doing so missira came up
test2782,any old chester is your room fellow is she not she said
test2783,i see by your face missus roe that you were distressed about something are you keeping anything back
test2784,i'm afraid i am replied liddie distress now in her tone
test2785,i must see her herself early in the morning and i'm quite sure that nothing will satisfy miss loderdale except a very ample apology and a full explanation of the reason why she absented herself
test2786,excuses make no difference
test2787,the girl who breaks the rules has to be punished
test2788,i will tell her
test2789,the commons also voted that the new created pairs ought to have no voice in this trial because the accusation being agreed to while the commoners their consent to it was implied with that of all the commons of england
test2790,in the government of irland his administration had been equally promoted of his master's interest and that of the subjects committed to his care
test2791,the case of lord montrose of all those which were collected with so much industry it is the most flagerant and the least excusable
test2792,the court which consisted of the cheap officials of the army found the crime to be capital and condemned that nobleman to lose his head
test2793,with a token by which i shall discover it
test2794,it is now a full two hundred and forty years since treasons were defined and so long has it been since any man was touched to this extent upon this crime before myself
test2795,let us not to our own destruction awake those sleeping lions by rattling up a company of old records which had been for so many ages by the wall forgotten and neglected
test2796,however these gentlemen at the bar say they speak for the commonwealth and they believe so yet under favour it is i who in this particular speak for the commonwealth
test2797,my lords i have now troubled your lordships a great deal longer than i should have done
test2798,young vain falling upon this paper of notes deemed the matter of the utmost importance and immediately communicated it to pim now who produced the paper before the house of commons
test2799,the king proposes this difficulty but how can i attain offensive war if i have no more money
test2800,your majesty having tried the affections of your people you are absolved and loose from all rules of government and may do what power will admit
test2801,old mister dinsmore had accepted a pressing invitation from his granddaughter and his husband to join the party and with the addition of servants it was a large one
test2802,as they were in no haste and the confinement of a railroad car would be very irksome to the younger children it had been decided to make the journey by water
test2803,there were no sad leave-takings to mar their pleasure the children were in wild spirits and all seemed cheerful and happy as they sat or stood upon the deck watching the receding shore as the vessel steamed out of the harbor
test2804,at lengths the land had quite disappeared nothing could be seen but the sky overhead and a vast expanse of water all round and the passengers found leisure to turn their attention upon each other
test2805,there are some nice looking people on board remarked mister traveler and an undertone to his wife
test2806,besides ourselves added cousin ronald laughing
test2807,yes she answered that little group yonder a young minister and his wife and child i suppose
test2808,and what a dear little fellow he is just about the age of our harvest i should judge
test2809,do you son was a smiling rejoinder
test2810,he certainly looks like a very nice little boy
test2811,suppose you and he shake hands frank
test2812,i do indeed they probably comparatively few are aware that tobacco is the cause of their ailments
test2813,doubtless it is the case remarked mister denton
test2814,with all my heart if you will step into the gentleman's cabin where there is a light
test2815,he led the way the others all following and taking out a slip of paper read from it in a distinct tone loud enough to be heard by those all about him without disturbing the other passengers
test2816,one drop of nicotine extract tobacco placed on the tongue of the dog will kill him in a minute coughing the hundredth part of a grain pricked under the skin of a man's arm will produce nausea and fainting
test2817,the half dozen cigarettes which most smokers use a day contain six or seven grains enough if concentrated and absorbed to kill three men and a pound of tobacco according to its quality contains from one quarter to one and a quarter ounces
test2818,is it strange that smokers and chewers have a thousand ailments
test2819,that the french polytechnique institute had to prohibit its use on account of its effects upon the mind
test2820,notices the multitude of sudden deaths and see how many are smokers and chewers
test2821,in a small country town seven of these mysterious providences occurred within the circle of a mile all directly traceable to tobacco and any physician on a few moments reflection can match this fact by his own observation
test2822,and then such powerful assets produce intense irritation and thirst thirst which water does not quench
test2823,hence a resort to cider and beer
test2824,no sir what no you not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which in you which you have of god and you are not your own
test2825,for you are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods
test2826,we certainly have no right to injure our bodies either by neglect or self indulgence
test2827,and again i beseech you therefore brothers by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice wholly acceptable to god which is your reasonable service
test2828,it must require a good deal of resolution for one who has become fond of the indulgence to give it up remarks mister dale
test2829,no doubt no doubt returned mr lilburn but if thy right hand afflicts thee put it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell
test2830,there was a pause broken by young horace who had been watching a group of men gathered about a table at the further end of the room
test2831,they're gambling yonder and i'm afraid that young fellow is being badly fleeced by the middle aged man opposite
test2832,the eyes of the whole party where it once turned in that direction
test2833,no sir he is not here
test2834,and the door was slammed violently too
test2835,now the voice came from the sky light overhead apparently and with a fierce implication the irate gamester rushed upon deck and ran hither and yonder in search of his tormenter
test2836,his victim who had been looking on during the little scene and listening to the mysterious voice in silent wide eyed wonder and fear now rose hastily his face deathly pale with trembling hands gathered up the money he had staked and hurrying to his state room locked himself in
test2837,what does it mean cried one
test2838,a ventriloquist's board of course returned another let's follow and see the fun
test2839,i wonder which of us it is remarked the first looking hard at our party i don't know but come on
test2840,that fellow nick ward was a noted blacklag and ruffian had his nose broken in a fight and is sensitive on the subject was cheating of course
test2841,who asked the mate i've seen one up here though there are some in the steerage
test2842,they heard him in silence with a cool phlegmatic indifference most exasperating to one in his present mood
test2843,a man of giant size and herculean strength had laid aside his pipe and slowly rising to his feet ceased the scoundrel in his powerful grasp
test2844,let me go yelled ward making a desperate effort to free his arms
test2845,i think no i think that you did you from me a lesson returned his captain not relaxing his grasp in the least
test2846,the german released his prisoner and the latter sank away with murmured threats and imprecations upon the head of his tormenter
test2847,mister biller and mister daley each at a different time sought out young man words intended victim and tried to influence him for good
test2848,yet there was gambling again the second night between ward and several of his professions
test2849,they kept it till after midnight
test2850,then mister lilburn waking from his first sleep and an estate room nearby thought he would break it up once more
test2851,an intense voiceless excitement possessed the players for the game was a close one and the stakes were very heavy
test2852,they vented eagerly over the board each watching with feverish anxiety his companions movements each casting now and again a glowing eye upon the heap of gold and green backs that lay between them and at times half stretching out his hand to clutch it
test2853,a deep groan startled them and they sprang to their feet pale and trembling with sudden terror each holding his breath and straining his ear to catch a repetition of the dread sound
test2854,but all was silent and after a moment of anxious waiting they sat down to their game again trying to conceal and shake off their fears to the forced natural laugh
test2855,it came from under the table gasterd look what's there look at yourself
test2856,what can it be they asked each other
test2857,oh nonsense what fools we are
test2858,it was the last game of cards for that trip
test2859,the captain coming in shortly after the sudden flight of the gamblers took charge of the money and the next day restored it to the owners
test2860,to elise's observant eyes it presently became evident that the dailies were in very straightened circumstances
test2861,oh how kind how very kind missus daisy said with tears of joy and gratitude we have hardly known how we should meet the most necessary expenses of this trip but have been trying to cast our care upon the lord asking him to provide
test2862,and how wonderfully he has answered our petitions
test2863,elise answered pressing her hand affectionately are you not sisters in christ
test2864,he is all the children of god by faith in christ jesus
test2865,he are all one in christ jesus
test2866,we feel my husband and i that we are only the stewards of his bounty and because he has said in as much as he has done it on to the least of these my brothers you have done it on to me it is the greatest privilege and delight to do anything for their people
test2867,"when it was the seven hundred and eighteenth night,"
test2868,but he answered needs my stye have jayne boulse now certainly they came a rap at the door and the maid said who is at the door
test2869,the nocker replied kamah daughter of azariah the jew say me is alli of kairo with you
test2870,replied the broker's daughter oh thou daughter of a dog
test2871,and having thus islamized she asked him two men in the faith of islam give marriage portions to women or two women our men
test2872,and she threw down the jew's head before him
test2873,now the cause of her slaying her siren was as follows
test2874,then he set out rejoicing to return to the barrack of the forty
test2875,so he ate and fell down senseless for the sweet meats were drugged with bung whereupon the cazi bound him into the sack and made off with him charger and chest and all to the barrack of the forty
test2876,presently hassan shumain came out of the closet and said to him have you got in the gear ohaly
test2877,so he told him what had befallen him and added if i know whether the rascal is gone and where to find the nave i would pay him out
test2878,no is that whither he went
test2879,answered hassan i know where he is and opening the door of the closet showed him the sweetmeat seller within drugged and senseless
test2880,so i went round about the highways of the city till i met a sweet meat seller and by his clothes and stock in trade and gear for ten dollars did what was done
test2881,quoth rachid whose head is this
test2882,so allie related to him all that had passed from first to last and the caliph said i had not thought that thou wouldst kill him for that he was a sorcerer
test2883,he replied i have forty lads but they are in cyprus
test2884,and laura had her own pet plans.
test2885,she meant to be scrupulously conscientious in the administration of a talent and sometimes at church on a sunday when the sermon was particularly awakening she mentally debated a serious question as to whether new bonnets and a pair of juvan's gloves daily were not sinful but i think she decided that the new bonnets and gloves were on the whole a pardoning weakness as being good for trade
test2886,one morning laura told her husband with a gay laugh that she was going to victimize him but he was to promise to be patient and bear with her for once in a way
test2887,i want to see all the pictures the modern pictures especially
test2888,i remember all the rubens says at the louvre for i saw them three years ago when i was staying in paris with grand papa
test2889,she returned in a little more than ten minutes in the freshest toilet all pale shining blue like the spring sky with purplish grey gloves and boots and parasol and a bonnet that seemed made of asian butterflies
test2890,he was drawing towards the close of this delightful honeymoon tour and it was a bright sunny morning early in february but february in paris is sometimes better than in london
test2891,but she fixed upon a picture which she said she preferred to anything she had seen in the gallery.
test2892,philip joshlin was examining some pictures on the other side of the room when his wife made his discovery
test2893,how i wish you could get me a copy of that picked up by philip laura said in treatingly
test2894,i should so like one to hang in my morning room at jessie's rock
test2895,she turned to the french artists presently and asked him where the elder mister coastle lived and if there was any possibility of seeing him
test2896,they have said that he is even a little imbecile that he does not remember himself of the most common events of his life
test2897,but there are some others who say that his memory has not altogether failed and that he is still hardly critical towards the works of others
test2898,i don't think you will have any difficulty in finding the house
test2899,you will be doing me such a favour philip if you say yes
test2900,his followers rushed forward to where he lay and their united force compelling the black knight to pause they dragged the wounded leader within the walls
test2901,it was on their journey to that town that they were overtaken on the road by sedric and his party in whose company they were afterwards carried captive to the castle of torquilstone
test2902,as he lay upon his bed racked with pain and mental agony and filled with the fear of rapidly approaching death he heard a voice address him
test2903,what art thou he exclaimed in terror
test2904,leave me and seek the saxon witch erica who was my temptress let her as well as i taste the tortures which anticipate hell
test2905,exclaimed the norman how
test2906,remember dost thou the magazine of fuel that it stores beneath these apartments woman
test2907,they are fast rising at least said ericka and a signal shall soon wave to warn the besiegers to press hard upon those who would extinguish them
test2908,meanwhile the black night had led his forces again to the attack and so vigorous was their assault that before long the gate of the castle alone separated them from those within
test2909,the defenders finding the castle to be on fire now determined to sell their lives as dearly as they could and headed by the brayse they threw open the gate and were at once involved in a terrible conflict with those outside
test2910,the black night with potentent strength forces his way inward in spite of the brassy and his followers
test2911,two of the foremost they instantly fell and the rest gave way without standing all the leaders efforts to stop them
test2912,the black knight was soon engaged in desperate combat with the norman chief and the voluted roof of the hall rang with furious blows
test2913,at length brassy fell
test2914,tell me thy name or thy pleasure on me
test2915,yet first let me say said brassy what it imports thee to know
test2916,exclaimed the black knight prisoner and perish
test2917,the life of every man in the castle shall answer it if a hair of his head be singed show me his chamber
test2918,raising the wounded man with ease the black knight rushed with him to the postern gate and having there delivered his burden to the care of two yeomen he again entered the castle to assist in the rescue of the other prisoners
test2919,but in other parts the besiegers pursued the defenders of the castle from chamber to chamber and besieged them in their blood the vengeance which had long animated them against the soldiers of the tyrant from the belfry
test2920,as the fire came to spread rapidly through all parts of the castle urika appeared on one of the turrets
test2921,before long the towering flames had surmounted every obstruction and rose to the evening skies one huge and burning beacon seen far and wide through the adjacent country tower after tower crashed down with blinding roof and rafter
test2922,at length with a terrible crash the whole turret gave way and she perished in the flames which had consumed her tyrant
test2923,when the outlaws had divided the spoils which they had taken from the castle of torquilstone sergeant prepared to take his departure
test2924,he left a gallant band of foresters sorrowing deeply for his lost friend the lord of conningburg and he and his followers had scarce parted when a procession moved slowly from under the green wood branches in the direction which he had taken in the center of which was the car in which the body of adeline was laid
test2925,to brayce bowed low and in silence threw himself upon a horse and galloped off through the wood
test2926,here is a bugle which an english showman has once worn i pray you to keep it as a memorial of your gallant bearing
test2927,so saying he mounted his strong warhorse and rode off through the forest
test2928,during all this time isaac of yorke sat mournfully apart grieving for the loss of his steady loved daughter rebecca
test2929,and with this epistle the happy old man set out to procure his daughter's liberation
test2930,the temple is fled said the brassy in answer to the prince's eager questions from the burh you will never see more and he added in a low and emphatic tone richard is in england i have seen him and spoken with him
test2931,he appealed to the brazeness to assist him in his project and became at once deeply suspicious of the night's loyalty towards him when he declined left hand against the man who had spared his own life
test2932,before reaching his destination he was told that lucas the bohemian the grand master of the order of the templars was then on visit to the precinctry
test2933,he had not until then been informed to the presence of the jewish maiden in the abode of the temples and great was his fury and indignation on learning that she was among them
test2934,poor isaac was hurried off accordingly and expelled from the precincts all his entreaties and even his offices unheard and disregarded
test2935,the assurance that she possessed some friend in this awful assembly gave a courage to look around and to mark into whose presence she had been conducted
test2936,she gazed accordingly upon a scene which might well have struck terror into a bold heart and hers
test2937,at his feet were placed a table occupied by two scribes whose duty was to record the proceedings of the day
test2938,the preceptors of whom they were four present occupied seats behind the superiors and behind them stood the acolytes of the order robed in white
