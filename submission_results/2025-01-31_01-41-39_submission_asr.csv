test0000,there's iron they say in all our blood and a grain or two perhaps is good but his he makes me harshly feel has got a little too much of steel anon
test0001,margaret said mister hale as he returned from showing his guests downstairs i could not help watching your face with some anxiety when mister thorne made his confession of having been a shop boy
test0002,you don't mean that you thought me so silly.
test0003,i really like that account of himself better than anything else he said.
test0004,his statement of having been a shop-boy was the thing i like best of all.
test0005,you who are always accusing people of being hopped at hilton?
test0006,i don't think mr. halloway you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been
test0007,i really was very afraid of showing him how much shocked i was at some parts of what he said.
test0008,his father dying in miserable circumstances
test0009,why it might have been in the workhouse?
test0010,his father speculated wildly failed and then killed himself because he could not bear the disgrace
test0011,all his former friends shrunk from the disclosures that had to be made of his honest gambling wild hopeless struggles made with other people's money to regain his own moderate portion of wealth
test0012,no one came forward to help the mother and this boy.
test0013,at least no friend came forward immediately and mister thorton is not one i fancy to wait till tardy kindness comes to find her out
test0014,so they lifted mountaine
test0015,how taint'd asked father
test0016,"oh, papa by that testing everything by the standard of wealth!"
test0017,when he spoke of the mechanical powers he evidently looked upon them only as new ways of extending trade and making money
test0018,and the poor men around him they were poor because they were vicious out of the pale of his sympathies because they had not his highest nature and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich
test0019,not vicious he never said that
test0020,in providence and self-indulgence were his words
test0021,margaret was collecting her mother's working materials and preparing to go to bed
test0022,just as she was leaving the room she hesitated she was inclined to make an acknowledgement which she thought would please her father but which to be full and true must include a little annoyance
test0023,however out came
test0024,papa i do think mr thorton a very remarkable man but personally i don't like him at all
test0025,"and i do, said her father, laughing."
test0026,personally as you call it and all
test0027,i don't set him up for a hero or anything of that kind.
test0028,"but good-night, child!"
test0029,"there were several other signs of something wrong about missus hale,"
test0030,she and dickson held mysterious consultations in a bedroom from which dickson would come out crying and cross as was accustomed when any distress of her mistress called upon her sympathy
test0031,once margaret had gone into the chamber soon after dickens left it and found her mother on her knees and as margaret stole out she caught a few words which were evidently a prayer for strength and
test0032,but though she received caresses and fond words back again in such profusion as would have glad her in formerly yet she felt that there was a secret withheld from her and she believed it bore serious
test0033,she lay awake very long this night planning how to lessen the evil influence of their milton's life on her mother
test0034,a servant give dickson permanent assistance should be got if she gave up the whole time to the search and then at any rate her mother might have all the personal attentions she required and had been accustomed
test0035,visiting register offices seeing all manner of unlikely people and very few in the least likely absorbed margaret's time and thoughts for several days
test0036,one afternoon she met bessie hickens in the street and stopped to speak to her
test0037,"well, bussy, how are you?"
test0038,"better, and not better if you know what that means."
test0039,not exactly replied margaret smiling.
test0040,i'm better in not being torn to pieces by coughing oaths but i'm weary and tired of milton and longing to get away to the land of bulla and when i think i'm
test0041,"margaret turned round to walk alongside of the girl in her feeble progress home,"
test0042,but for a mineral or two she did not speak.
test0043,at last she said in a low voice
test0044,bessy do you wish to die?
test0045,bessy was silent in her turn for a minute or two then she replied
test0046,not worse than many others i reckon.
test0047,but what was it?
test0048,you know i'm a stranger here so perhaps i'm not so quick at understanding what you mean as if i'd lived all my life in milton.
test0049,i had forgotten what i said for the time continued margaret quietly
test0050,i should have thought of it again when i was less busy may i go with you now?
test0051,the sharpness in her eye turned to a wistful longing as she met margaret's soft and friendly gaze
test0052,as they turned up into a small court opening out into a squatted street bessey said
test0053,you'll not be daunted at your father's home and speaks a bit gruff at first.
test0054,but nicholas was not at home when they entered.
test0055,"gassippi at last,"
test0056,bessy took a long and feverish draft and then fell back and shut her eyes
test0057,margaret bent over and said bessey don't be in pain with your life whatever it is or may be
test0058,"remember who gave it to you and made it what it is,"
test0059,"now i'll not have my wench preach to,"
test0060,but surely said margaret facing round you believe in what i said that god gave her life and ordered what kind of life it was to be
test0061,i believe what i see and no more.
test0062,"that's what i believe, young woman."
test0063,"i don't believe all that i hear no, not by big deal."
test0064,but who's come at last and who's welcome as long as he'll keep from preaching on what who knows not about
test0065,"it's simple, and not far to fetch nor hard to work."
test0066,"but the girl only played it the more with margaret,"
test0067,don't think hardily on him he's a good man he is.
test0068,i sometimes think i shall be mirthed with sorrow even in the city of god your father is not there.
test0069,the feverish color came into her cheeks and the feverish flame into her eye.
test0070,"but you'll be there, father, you shall oh, my heart,"
test0071,she brought her aunt to it and became ghastly pale.
test0072,margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to rest upon her bosom
test0073,presently the spasm that foretold death had passed away and bessie roused herself and said
test0074,i'll go to bed its best place but catching margaret's gown you'll come again i know you will but just say it
test0075,"i'll come to morrow, said margaret."
test0076,margaret went away very sad and thoughtful.
test0077,she was late for tea at home.
test0078,have you met with a servant dear?
test0079,no ma'am that anne bucknell would never have done
test0080,"suppose i try said mr. hell,"
test0081,everybody else has had their turn at this great difficulty now let me try
test0082,i may be the cinderella to put on the slipper after all.
test0083,"what would you do, papa? how would you set about it?"
test0084,well i would i would i would put it to some good house-mother to recommend me one known to herself or her servants
test0085,very good but we must first catch our house-mother.
test0086,"the mother of whom he spoke to us, said margaret,"
test0087,mr. thorton the only mother he has i believe said mr. halloway quietly
test0088,i shall like to see her she must be an uncommon person her mother added
test0089,perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us and be glad of our place
test0090,she sounded to be such a careful economical person that i should like any one out of the same family
test0091,"my dear, said mr. hellal, alarmed pray don't go off on that idea."
test0092,i'm sure at any rate she would not like strangers to know anything about it
test0093,take notice that this is not my kind of horatius papa if i have any at all which i disagree to though you are always accusing me of it
test0094,i don't know positively that it is hers either but from little things i have gathered from him i fancy so
test0095,they cared too little to ask in what manner her sun had spoken about her
test0096,if called to a case supposed to be one of poisoning the medical man has two duties to perform to save the patient's life and to place himself in a position to give evidence called on to do so
test0097,he should make inquiries as to symptoms and time at which fruit or medicine was last taken
test0098,he should notice the position and temperature of the body the condition of rigour mortis marks of violence appearance of lips and mouth
test0099,in making a postmodem examination the elementary canal should be removed and preserved for further investigation
test0100,the gut and the gallbladder being cut across between these ligaments the stomach may be removed entirely without spilling its contents
test0101,if the medical practitioner is in doubt on any point he should obtain technical assistance from some one who has paid attention to the subject
test0102,in a case of attempted suicide by poisoning is it the duty of the doctor to inform the police
test0103,the best madam is that which is at hand
test0104,the days for an adult is ten minutes
test0105,epomorphosis is not allied in physiological action to morphogenesis and may be given in cases of narcotic poisoning
test0106,ticking the forces with a fizzle make side vomiting
test0107,in using the elastic stomach tube some fluid should be introduced into the stomach before attempting to empty it or a portion of the mucous membrane may be sucked into the aperture
test0108,the tube should be examined to see that it is not broken or cracked as accidents have happened from neglecting this precaution
test0109,antidotes are usually given hyperematically or if a mouth in the form of tablets
test0110,in the absence of a hypertonic syringe the remedy may be given by the rectum
test0111,notice the small color and general appearance of the matter submitted for examination
test0112,for the separation of an alkaloid the following is the process of stauroto
test0113,this process is based upon the principle that the salts of the alkalies are soluble in alkaline water and insoluble in ether
test0114,the pure alcohols with the exception of morphine in its crystalline form are soluble in ether
test0115,two cool the mixture and filter wash the residue with strong alcohol and mix the filtrates
test0116,the residue may be set aside for the detection of the metallic poisons if suspected expel the alcohol by careful evaporation
test0117,on the evaporation of the alcohol the wisness and fat matter separate
test0118,evaporate the filtrate to a syrup and extract with successive portions of absolute alcohol
test0119,separate the ethereal solution and reaprate
test0120,five a part of this ethereal solution is poured into a watch glass and allowed to evaporate
test0121,to purify it add a small quantity of dilute sulphuric acid and after evaporating to three quarters of its bulk add a saturated solution of carbamate of potash ash or soda
test0122,boil the finely divided substance with about one eighth its bulk of pure hydrochloric acid add from time to time potash chloride until the solids are reduced to a straw yellow fluid
test0123,the residue of the material after digestion with hydrochloric acid and potassium chlorate and potassium chlorate may have to be examined for silver lead and barium
test0124,"a thousand blessings from a great heart,"
test0125,purrsell said the pawnbroker that's the way to pronounce it
test0126,his books told him that treasure is best hidden under loose boards and as of course your house has a secret panel which his had not
test0127,he got it up and pushed his treasures as far as he could along the rough crumbling surface of the las and plaster
test0128,when dickie came down his aunt slapped him and he took the half penny and limped off obediently
test0129,he had never seen one before and it interested him extremely
test0130,he looked at him and knew that he did not at all know where he was
test0131,what's that matey lost your way dickie explained
test0132,when he said have i ever been asleep?
test0133,here we set them in
test0134,not exactly said the man but it's all right
test0135,when it was over the man asked dickie if he could walk a little way and when dickie said he could they set out in the most friendly way side by side
test0136,and the tea and all and the egg
test0137,and this is the prettiest place ever i see
test0138,i should catch it a fair treat as it is
test0139,she was waiting for the wood to boil the kettle when out came mother

test0147,the man's manner was so kind and tarty the whole adventure was so wonderful and new is it country where you're going
test0148,the sun shot long golden beams through the gaps in the hedge
test0149,a bird passed in its flight on a branch quite close and clung their sway
test0150,he took out of his pocket a new envelope and a new pencil ready sharpened by machinery
test0151,and i ask you let me come along you got that
test0152,get it written down then. done.
test0153,then he folded it and put it in his pocket.
test0154,now we are square he said
test0155,they could put men away for less than that
test0156,i see that in the book that i read it shone
test0157,he rewarded the wake the last of the english and i wondered what it stood for
test0158,"whites once and half a size, i lay,"
test0159,adventures i should think so.
test0160,ah said dicky and a full silence fell between them
test0161,that was charming but it was pleasant too to wash the mud off the wet grass
test0162,dickie always remembered that moment
test0163,so you shall say mr beale a regular wash all over this very night i always wash myself
test0164,some folks think it pays to be dirty but it don't

test0170,well you'll know all about it presently
test0171,the singing and laughing when john long after had fallen asleep and if later in the evening there were loud voiced arguments or quarrels even dickie did not hear them
test0172,what's on that there dickie asked pointing to the odd noobly bundles of all sorts and shapes tied on to the perambler's front
test0173,tell what maid looks to me as if i took a fancy to you
test0174,swabbed me he said helplessly
test0175,oh look at digby the flowers

test0178,hi there goes a rabbit.
test0179,yes? which to be? yes.
test0180,"how beautiful, said dickie, wriggling with delight"
test0181,this life of the rabbit as described by mister beale was the child's first glimpse of freedom i'd like to be a rabbit
test0182,how am i to wear the room in pram if you goas like as if you were a beggar of feels

test0195,but you said the bed was with the green curtains eekie
test0196,which this end not by any means
test0197,the night is full of interesting little sounds that will not at first let you sleep the rustle of little white things in the hatches the barking of dogs in distant farms the chirping of cr
test0198,the new game of bagging and inventing stories to interest the people from whom it was worth while to bag were on gayly day by day and week by week and dick by constant practice grew so
test0199,blessed if i ever see such a nippy he said over and over again
test0200,clueless as a train dog is and all out his own net
test0201,i am sure as i better stick to the road and keep away from old ones like you jim
test0202,i hope he's clever enough to do what he's told keep his mug shut that's all
test0203,if he is straight he'll do for me and in the end i'll do for him. see.
test0204,see that bloke just now said mr beale yes said dicky
test0205,well you never see him
test0206,if any one asked you if you ever see him you never said eyes on him in all your born not to remember him
test0207,dickie was full of questions but mister beale had no answers for them
test0208,nor was it sunday on which they took a rest and washed their shirts according to mister beeld's rule of life
test0209,they did not stay there but walked out across the dawns with the skylarks singing and on a dip of the dawns came upon great stone walls and towers very strong and grey
test0210,what's that there said dickie
test0211,replied he of a truth i heard him not and i want him not and folks are all sleeping
test0212,but she said whomso ever thou seest awake he is the reciter
test0213,then said the unicorn are thou who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him
test0214,rejoined the unicorn who then was the reciter point him out to me
test0215,by law replied the fieryman i tell thee the truth
test0216,tell me what happened quoth the raven as quoth the raven
test0217,what else did then that thou must needs recite verses seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the folk are asleep for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue
test0218,and he also improvised the two following stiches
test0219,when aunt alasman heard the first improvisation she called to mine father and her mother and her brother and their willom home then she wept and cried to the unicorn and said to him w
test0220,he who recited the first time hath recited a second time and i heard him hard by
test0221,by allah and thou fetchest him not to me i will assuredly raise thee chamberlain on thee and he shall beat thee and cast thee out
test0222,but take these hundred diners and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently and do him no hurt
test0223,return quickly and linger not
test0224,when it was the seventy third night
test0225,but the youngook said i will not leave thee till thou show me who it was that recited the verses for i dread returned to my lady without him
test0226,now when the firefighter heard these words he feared for zawal macan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the unit by allah it was not i and i know him not
test0227,so go thou to thy station and if thou again meet any one after this hour reciting oth of poetry whether he be near or far it will be i or some one i know and thou shalt
test0228,then he kissed the onok's head and spake him fair till he went away but the castro fetched around and returning secretly came and stood behind the firefighter fearing to go back to his mistress without
test0229,i say what made my ignominy whatever the bitter cup i drain far be from me that i land to flee nor will i bow to those who blame and for such love would meet me shame
test0230,then said the young to zavaliman peace be with thee my lord
test0231,oh my lord continued the unicorn and sherazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
test0232,we will do thee no outrage on my son nor wrong thee in it but our object is that thou bowest thy gracious steps with me to my mistress to receive her answer and returning will and safety
test0233,then the young went out to zawal makan and said to him recite what verses thou knowest for my ladies here heart by heart listening to thee and after i will ask thee of thy
test0234,and also these
test0235,then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twain fell down in a fainting fit
test0236,when the yunus saw this case he wondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them waited till they should recover
test0237,after a while they came to themselves and usada alasan rejoiced with exceeding joy oppression and depression left her and gladness took the mastery of her and she repeated these verses
test0238,accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the khan and what had happened to her with the badawi how the merchant had bought her of him and had taken her
test0239,but now go to thy master and bring him quickly to me
test0240,the chamberlet called the castro and charged him to do accordingly so he replied i hear and i obey and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the stalker till he found
test0241,"she said it hath reached me, o hospitable king, that when the stalker girded his ass for flight and bespake himself saying o would i knew what he is become of him"
test0242,i believe he hath denounced me to the unicorn hence these pages at about me and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime
test0243,why didst thou say i never repeated these cuplets nor do i know who repeated them when it was thy companion
test0244,but now i will not leave thee between this place and bagdad and what betideth thy comrade shall be thine
test0245,it was as i feared the coming of the millenium's discerning but on to ala we are all returning
test0246,then the unicorn cried upon his pages saying take him off the ass
test0247,and he answered i am the chamberlain of the emir of damascus king sharkan son of omar bin noman lord of abbad and of the land of khorasan and i bring
test0248,so farey forwards no harm shall befall you till you join his grand vizier danum
test0249,then he bet him be seated and questioned him and he replied that he was chambreling to the emperor of damascus and was bound to king omar with presence and the tribute of syria
test0250,so it was agreed that we went to damascus and fetched dense the king's son charan and make him sultan over his father's realm
test0251,and amongst them were some who would have chosen the cadet zawah al-makhan for quoth day his name be light of the place and he hath a sister nozwa al-alam
test0252,so he turned to the vizier dan and said to him verily thy tale is a wonder of wonders
test0253,know o chief vizier that here where you have encountered me allah hath given you rest from fatigue and brings you your desire after the easiest of fashions for that his almighty will restore it
test0254,when the minister heard these words he rejoiced with great joy and said o chamberlain tell me the tale of the twaine and what befell them and the cause of their long absence
test0255,zawa macan bowed his head a while and then said i accept the position for indeed there was no refusing and he was certified that the chamberlain had counseled him well and wisely and set
test0256,then he added oh my uncle how shall i do with my brother sharkin
test0257,after a while the dust dispersed and air appeared under it the army of bagdad and khorasan a conquering host like the pool tides sea and chazaras perceived the dawn of day and
test0258,"when it was the seventeenth night,"
test0259,and in it all rejoice at the accession of the light of the place
test0260,lastly the minister went in and kissed the ground before zawal al-makkan who rose to meet him saying welcome o vizier and sire's son peer
test0261,moreover the sultan commanded his vizier and done call a ten days halt of the army that he might be private with him and learn from him how and wherefore his father had been slain
test0262,he then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host to halt ten days
test0263,what has happened to me
test0264,he asked himself something warm and living quicken me it must be in the neighborhood
test0265,when however the rustica was quite nigh unto them then did he hear plainly let human voice speak in the midst of the kind and apparently all of them had turned their heads towards the speaker
test0266,for do i hear thee seek
test0267,answered he the same that thou seest thou mischief maker that is to say happiness upon earth
test0268,for i tell thee that i have already talked half a morning unto them and just now were they about to give me their answer
test0269,he would not be rid of his affliction
test0270,who had not at present his heart his mouth and his eyes full of disgust
test0271,that was also that was also
test0272,but behold this kind
test0273,the kind however gazed at it all and wondered
test0274,wanted an austerity beille's envy popular pride all these struck my eye
test0275,it is no longer true that the poor are blessed
test0276,the kingdom of heaven however is with the kind and why is it not with the rich
test0277,why dost thou doubt me
test0278,answered the other
test0279,thou knowest it thyself better even than i
test0280,thus beguiled the peaceful one and puffed himself and pleased with his words so that the kind one wondered a new
test0281,thou dost wrestle to thyself thy priest on the mount and thou useth to such saviour words
test0282,they also abstain from all heavy throats which inflame the heart
test0283,well
test0284,said stuartra thou shouldst also see mine animals mine eagle and mine serpent their like do not at present exist on earth
test0285,and talk to mine animals of the happiness of animals
test0286,now however take leave atwards of their kind thou strange one
test0287,thou amiable one
test0288,for they are thy warmest friends and persecutors
test0289,thou ev'ylister
test0290,with her hat my loneliness's call spoke he
test0291,my shadow calleth me
test0292,what matter about my shadow
test0293,let it run after me i run away from it
test0294,thus passed to his heart and ran away
test0295,wearily my folly has grown big in the mountains
test0296,now do i hear six old fools legs rattling behind one another
test0297,but those at ostrus need to be frightened by his shadow
test0298,also me think it after all it had long or less than mine
test0299,who when their two tricks scoundrelized him with his glance he was frightened as by a sudden apparition so sly and sophisticated hollow and wan out did his follower appear
test0300,as they twitched vehemently what do we stow here
test0301,and why call'st thou that i served my shadow
test0302,thou art not pleasing unto me
test0303,must i ever be on the way
test0304,o arth thou hast become too round for me
test0305,when the devil casteth his skin doth not his name also fall away it is also skin
test0306,the devil himself is perhaps skin
test0307,sometimes i meant to lie and behold
test0308,then only did i hate that truth
test0309,how have i still inclinations
test0310,have i still a goal?
test0311,i haven't words which my sail is set
test0312,for it too i ask and seek and have sought but have not found it
test0313,o eternal everywhere o eternal nowhere o eternal in vain
test0314,thou art my shadow
test0315,said he sadly
test0316,thy danger is not small thou free spirit and wanderer
test0317,they sleep quietly they enjoy their new security
test0318,be wary lest in the end a narrow faith capture thee a hard rigorous delusion
test0319,for now everything that is narrow and fixed seduce it and tempt it day by day
test0320,thou hast lost thy goal
test0321,thou poor rover and rammer thou tired but to fly
test0322,will thou have a rest at home this evening
test0323,once upon a time a brummagem who was walking along the road came upon an iron cage in which a great tiger was shut up by the villagers who caught him
test0324,the brahmin answered no i will not for if i let you out of the cage you will eat me
test0325,o father of mercy answered the tiger in truth that i will not
test0326,i will never be so ungrateful only let me out that i may drink some water and return
test0327,then the brummagem took pity on him and opened the cage door but sooner had he turned so that the tiger jumping out said now i will eat you first and drink the water afterwards
test0328,so the brahmans and the tiger walked on till they came to a barren tree and the brahmans said to it barren tree barren tree hear and give heed
test0329,on what must i give judgment as the benedict tree
test0330,this tiger said the brahmin begged me to let him out of his cage to drink a little water and he promised not to hurt me if i did so but now that i have left him out
test0331,it is just that he should do so or no
test0332,let the tiger eat the man for men are ungrateful race
test0333,sir camel sir camel cried the brahmin hear and give judgment
test0334,at a little distance they found a bullock lying by the road side
test0335,is it fair that he should do so or not
test0336,let the tiger eat the man for men have no pity
test0337,three out of the six and given judgment against the bramman but still he did not lose all hope and determined to as the other three
test0338,on what must i give thee judgment as the devil
test0339,the bramah said the case and the eagle answered whenever men see me they tried to shoot me they climbed the rocks and steal away my little ones
test0340,then the tiger began to roar and said judgment of all is against you o bramman
test0341,after this they saw an aligator and the bramah related the matter to him hoping for a more favourable verdict
test0342,but the aligator said when i put my nose out of the water men tormented me and tried to kill me
test0343,the brummagem gave himself up as lost but again he prayed the tiger to have patience and let him ask the opinion of the sixth judge
test0344,now the sixth was jack hawthorne
test0345,the braham told his story and said to him uncle jackel uncle jackel say what is your judgment
test0346,show me the pace
test0347,when they got there the jackal said now roman show me exactly where you stood
test0348,exactly there was it asked jacob
test0349,exactly here replied the bramin
test0350,where was the tiger then
test0351,why i stood so said the tiger jumping into the cage and my head was on this side
test0352,very good said jacques but i cannot judge without understanding the whole matter exactly
test0353,shut and bolted said the bramah
test0354,then shut and bolted the set the jackhole
test0355,when the brahmans had had this the jackal said oh you wicked and ungrateful tiger
test0356,when a good bramin opened your case is to eat him the only return you would make
test0357,proceed on your journey frank ramman
test0358,your road lies that way and mind this
test0359,thus accomplished he excited the admiration of every silly quokka and the envy of every fluttering cock and the envy of every fluttering cock but by all young gentlemen and ladies of understanding he was
test0360,that his soul might afterwards occupy such a station as would be most suitable to his character it was intense to inhale the body of that phenicial grinning and mechem's little mimic with four
test0361,the moses was afraid and said surely that thing is known
test0362,hold on hold fast hold fast hold fast patience is genius
test0363,let's have faith that right makes right and in that faith let's there to do our duty if we understand it lincoln
test0364,the egyptian background of the bondage
test0365,every one who is tribune has been found by kimnar path the testimony of the oldest biblical narratives regarding the sojourn of the hebrews in egypt is also in perfect accord with the
test0366,the absence of detailed reference to the hebrews is therefore perfectly natural
test0367,it seems probable that not all but only part of the tribes which ultimately carvedets into the hebrew nation found their way to egypt
test0368,the stories regarding joseph their traditional father ephram and manasseh incline that these strong central tribes possibly together with the southern tribes of benjamin and judah were the chief actors in its
test0369,the biblical narratives apparently disagree regarding the duration of the sojourn in egypt
test0370,the later traditions tend to extend the period
test0371,he were found several inscriptions bearing the egipsian name of the citi patam house of the god atam
test0372,a contemporary script and also states that he found near pithom the house of ramses a city with the royal residences and temples
test0373,that the hebrews were accursed under this sinning was naturally inevitable
test0374,was any other procedure to be spectered from it the despotic roar of that land and bay
test0375,the making of a loyal patriot
test0376,the story of moses his birth in early childhood is one of the most interesting chapters in biblical history
test0377,which moves its justified and resists the gipsy's taskmaster
test0378,is penning's always disasters not only to its victims but also to the government imposing it
test0379,nativity he waxes in land of midian
test0380,the wilderness to the east of egypt had for centuries been the plates of refuge for egyptians fugitives
test0381,from about two thousand and six
test0382,on the borders of the wetlands he found certain beidou herdsmen who received him hospitably
test0383,these sand-wanderers sent him on from tribe to tribe until he reached the land of kedum each of the dead sea where he remained for a year and a half
test0384,later he found his way to the court of one of the local kings in central palestine where he married and became in the time a prosperous local prince
test0385,the score of the wherunto
test0386,the story of moses is in many ways closely parallel to that of sinai
test0387,the priest the sub tribe of the kinaites received him into his home and gave him his daughter in marriage
test0388,note the carthaginian oriental idea of marriages
test0389,here moses learned the lessons that were essential for his training as a leader and deliverer of his people
test0390,after the capture of jericho certain of them went up with the southern tribes to conquer southern palestine
test0391,many modern scholars drew the conclusion from the biblical narrative that it was from the kinites that moses first learned of yahweh or as the distinct name of israel's god was translated
test0392,do the oryatese traditions imply that the ancestors of the israelites were worshippers of jehovah
test0393,the title of his fondness in law implies that this priest ministered at some lutheran sanctuary
test0394,hosea in the home of the mendian priest was brought into direct and constant contact with the hebrew worship
test0395,the cruel fate of his people and the painful experience in egypt that had driven him into the wilderness prepared his mind to receive this training
test0396,its quest was for a jets and strong gun able to deliver the oppressed
test0397,the wilderness with its lurking foes and the ever present dread of hunger and thirst deepens its sense of need and of dependence upon the power able to guide the debt's needs of men
test0398,the pessants of the vatantonian plain of central asia minor still call every life given spring god have given
test0399,the constant necessity of meeting the dangers of the wilderness and defending the flock entranced to moses care developed his courage in power of leadership and action
test0400,evidently the intention was to make things present for the royal folk during his visit
test0401,the probitsin and the regulus quota as a smoking in st. mary's church referred it may be noted to the act which was held therin
test0402,sometimes tobacco is used in church for disinfecting or deodorizing purposes
test0403,brockburn art spits of york who was a great smoker
test0404,on one occasion he was at st mary's church near hampton for a confirmation
test0405,another eighteen century clerical worthy the famous doctor parr an envirrate smoker was accustomed to do what mister daisy prevented arches at blackburn from doing he smoked in his vestry at
test0406,pare was such a continual smoker that any one who came into his company if he had never smoked before and to learn the use of a pipe as a means of self defence
test0407,one sunday says mister ditchfield he had a natter pipe and joshua the clerk told him that the people were getting impatient
test0408,them singing an other songs like the kyrie
test0409,they have sir repyant clerk
test0410,then let them sing the hundred and nineteenth be the part of the curate
test0411,six arms the nearest within reach presented with an obedient start as many tobacco pouches to the man of office
test0412,david dean hadver not at all improved this irreverance
test0413,going to church st. hazy in those days must have been quite in the announcing experience
test0414,when these men in the course of my remembrance found out that it was not going to continue the cousin they no longer cared to be communicants
test0415,parrots in that quarter where user destroyed by the sipseys is true but the c s four of them far more are innocent than are guilty of any acts of violence
test0416,now after the sun had set the wind fell to an inlet of air that just kept steerage way on the ship
test0417,fortunately the john was not only fat but she minded her helm as a light footed girl turns in a lively dance
test0418,i never was in a better steersman's skip poesy spake in moderate weather
test0419,mr marble he owed to believe was fairly snivelling on the hinkups being like the cells as one might say very asleep
test0420,at that moment i heard a noise we were familiar to see men that of an oar falling in the boat
test0421,saying it sail ho and close abroad
test0422,he was too much of a seaman to require a second look in order to ascertain what was to be done
test0423,although they went three feet to two this gave us a moment of breathing time
test0424,as our seats were off lying forward and remained so for a few minutes it gave me a leisure to look about
test0425,i soon saw both procs and grudgingly was i to perceive that they had not approached materially near
test0426,micky caye deserved this so on the remark that our movements had been so prompt as to take the rascals as back
test0427,a prefect's stillness succeeded
test0428,the poets did not alter the course but neared as fast
test0429,i heard the rattling of the boarding pikes too as they were cut adrift from the spiking boom and fell upon the decks
test0430,kite went out and returned with three or four mascots and as many pipes
test0431,the stillness that rang on both sides was like that of depth
test0432,the jay behaved beautifully he ran like a cat
test0433,the question was now whether we could pass them or not before they got near to grapple
test0434,the captain behaved perfectly well in its critical instance commanding in dead silence and the closest intentions to his orders
test0435,now i'm so old and bored the john was heart
test0436,on our side we gave the gentlemen the four sixes two at the nearest and two at the sternest prow which was still near a cables length to its side
test0437,they were like the ayes of fenian in english
test0438,i doubt if we touched the man in the neeps and tatties
test0439,that state the ship passed ahead all of her canvas beam for leaving the prow moostress in her wake
test0440,they swam up in front of shermer's pales as thick as they could jam together and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise
test0441,some sung out tear down the fence tear down the fence
test0442,the stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable
test0443,sherburn ran his eyes slow along the crowd and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out gaze him but they couldn't they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky
test0444,the average men are cowardly
test0445,because they're afraid the man's friends will shoot them in the back in the dark and it's just what they would do
test0446,so they always acquire and then a man goes in the night with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lances the rascal
test0447,you didn't want to come
test0448,but a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pettiness
test0449,now leave and take your half a man with you tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this
test0450,the crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearing off every which way and buck harkens he healed it after them looking tolerable cheap
test0451,you can't be too careful
test0452,they argued and tried to keep him out but he wouldn't listen and a whole show came to a standstill
test0453,and one or two women began to screen
test0454,so then the ring master he made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he would let him ride if he
test0455,it weren't funny to me though i was all of a tremble to see his danger
test0456,and the horse are going like a house of fire to.
test0457,he shed him so thick they knew oflogged up the air and altogether he shed seventeen suits
test0458,why it was one of his own men
test0459,and but never mind the rest of his outfit it was just wild but it was awful funny
test0460,the people most killed themselves laughing and when the king got done capering and capering off behind the scenes they roared and clapped and stormed and howled till he came back and done it over
test0461,twenty people sings out
test0462,the duke says yes
test0463,everybody sings out sold
test0464,but a big fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts hold on
test0465,just a word gentlemen they stopped to listen
test0466,what we want is to go out of here quiet and talk this show up and sell the rest of the town
test0467,you bet it is the judge is right everybody sings out
test0468,we struck the raft at the same time and in less than two seconds we were gliding downstream all dark and still and edging towards the middle of the river nobody saying a word
test0469,we never showed a light till we was about ten miles below the village
test0470,green horns flat heads
test0471,no i say it don't
test0472,well it don't because it's in debt i reckon they're all a lot
test0473,well that's what i'm a saying all kings are mostly rapscallions as far as i can make out is that so
test0474,and look at charles second and lewis fourteenth and lewis fifteen and james second and edward second and richard third and forty more besides all those saxons heptarchies that used
test0475,my you are to seeing old henry the eight when he was in bloom he was a blossom
test0476,ring up fair rosamond
test0477,well henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country
test0478,suppose he opened his mouth what then
test0479,all i say is kings are kings and you got to make allowances
test0480,take them all around they're a mighty ornery lot it's the way they're raised
test0481,well they all do jim
test0482,now to duke he's tolerable like the man in some ways
test0483,this one's a middle and hard lot for a duke.
test0484,when i woke up just a day break he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees moaning and mourning to himself
test0485,it don't seem natural but i reckon so
test0486,he was often moaning and mourning that way nights when he judged i was asleep and saying po little leslie
test0487,don't you hear me shut that do
test0488,i lay i make you mine
test0489,just as loud as i could yell
test0490,which was sound enough judgment but you took the average man and he wouldn't wait for him to how
test0491,the king's duds was all black and he did look real swell and starchy
test0492,why before he looked like the ornate old rip that ever was but now when he take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile he looked that grand and good and p
test0493,jim cleaned up the canoe and i got my paddle ready
test0494,where are you bound for young man
test0495,"get aboard, says the king."
test0496,i did so and then we all three started on again
test0497,the young chap was mighty thankful said it was tough work touting his baggage such weather.
test0498,he asked the king where he was going and the king told him he'd come down the river and landed at the other village this morning and now he was going up a few miles to see an old
test0499,but then i say again no i reckon he ain't him or else he wouldn't be paddlin up the river you ain't him are you
test0500,no my name is bodge alexander bodge i suppose i must say as i am one of the large poor servants
test0501,you see he was pretty old and george's gauriers was too young to be much company for him except mary jane the red headed one and so he was kinder or less lonely after ge
test0502,too bad too bad he couldn't have lived to see his brother's poor soul
test0503,i'm going in a ship next wendesday for riyoga jena where my uncle is
test0504,but it'll be lovely wished i was a going
test0505,mary jane's nineteen susan's fifteen and joanna's about fourteen that's the one that gives herself to good works and has a hairlip poor things
test0506,well they could be worse off
test0507,old peter had friends and they ain't gonna let them come to no harm
test0508,blamed if he didn't acquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town and all about the wilkeses and about peter's business which was a tanner and about georges which was a carp
test0509,when they're deep they won't stop for a hell.
test0510,was peter wilks well off?
test0511,when we struck the boat she was about done loading and pretty soon she got off
test0512,now hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the new carpet bags
test0513,so then they waited for a steamboat.
test0514,that the king was calm he says
test0515,they gave a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to say would they tell you
test0516,then one of them says kind of soft and gentle
test0517,felps was one of these little one horn cotton plantations and they all looked alike
test0518,i went around and climbed over the back style by the ash hopper and started for the kitchen
test0519,out with a yes sir four i thought
test0520,so then she started for the house leading me by the hand and the children tagging after
test0521,when we got there she set me down in a split bottom chair and set herself down on a little stool in front of me holding both of my hands and says
test0522,well it's lucky because sometimes people do get hurt
test0523,and i think he died afterwards he was a baptist
test0524,yes it was mortification that was it
test0525,your uncle's been up to the town every day to fetch you
test0526,you must have met him on the road didn't you older man with a
test0527,why child it'll be stole
test0528,it was kinder thin ice but i says
test0529,i had my mind on the children all the time i wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little and find out who i was
test0530,pretty soon she made the cold chill streak all down my back because she says
test0531,i see it weren't a bit of try to go ahead i'd got to throw up my hand
test0532,so i say to myself here's another place where i got to rest the truth
test0533,i opened my mouth to begin but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed and says here it comes
test0534,children don't you say a word
test0535,i see i was in a fix now
test0536,missus felps she jumps for him and says
test0537,has he come no says her husband
test0538,i can imagine says the old gentleman and i must say it makes me dreadfully uneasy
test0539,uneasy she says i'm ready to go distracted
test0540,he must have come and you've missed him along the road.
test0541,"oh, don't distress me anymore and i'm already distressed"
test0542,why silas look yonder up the road ain't that somebody comin
test0543,the old gentleman stared and says
test0544,i ain't no idea who is
test0545,it's tom sowerby
test0546,being tom sowerby was easy and comfortable and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by i hear a steamboat coughing along down the river
test0547,then i say to myself suppose tim shore comes down on that boat
test0548,but i am hugely pleased that you have seen my lady
test0549,i knew you could not choose but like her yet let me tell you you have seen but the worst of her
test0550,her conversation has more charms than can be in mere beauty and a humor and disposition would make a deformed person appear lovely
test0551,why did you not send me that news and a garland
test0552,well the best on it is that i have a squaire now that is as good as a knight
test0553,in earnest we have had such a skirmish and upon so foolish an occasion as i cannot tell which strangers are
test0554,all the people that i had ever in my life refused were brought again upon the stage like richard the third ghosts to reproach me with whorl and all the kindness his discoveries could make me
test0555,my best qualities if i have any that are good served but for aggravations of my fault and was allowed to have wit and understanding and discretion in other things that it might appear i had none in this
test0556,this is strange change and i am very sorry for it but i swear i know not how to help it
test0557,mr fish is a squire of dames and has so many mistresses than anybody may pretend to share in him and be believed but though i have the honour to be his near neighbour to speak freely
test0558,i think my younger brother comes down with him
test0559,i can no sooner give you some little hints whereabout they live but you know them presently and i meant you should be beholding to me for your acquaintance
test0560,but it seems this gentleman is not so easy access but you may acknowledge something due to me if you incline him to look graciously upon you and therefore there is not much harm done
test0561,i have missed four fits and i have but had five and have recovered so much strength as made me venture to meet your letter on wednesday a mile from home
test0562,but besides i can give you others
test0563,i am here much more out of people's way than in town where my aunt and such as pretend interest in me and a power over me do so persecute me with their dear good nature and take
test0564,you will think him altered and if it were possible more melancholy than he was
test0565,if marriage agrees no better with other people than it does with him i shall pray that all my friends may escape it
test0566,well in earnest if i were a prince that lady should be my mistress but i can give no rule to any one else and perhaps those that are in no danger of losing their hearts to her may be
test0567,the matter is not great for i confess i naturally hate the noise and talk of the world and should be best pleased never to be known in it upon any occasion whatsoever yet since it can never be wholly
test0568,"if i had a picture that will fit for you, you should have it."
test0569,how can you talk of defying fortune nobody lives without it and therefore why should you imagine you could
test0570,i know not how my brother comes to be so well informed as you say but i am certain he knows yeatmost of the injuries you have received from her
test0571,we have had another debate but much more calmly
test0572,and besides there was a time when we ourselves were indifferent to one another did i do so then or have i learned it since
test0573,i have been studying how tom cheek might come by his intelligence and i very believe he has it from my cousin peters
test0574,how kindly do i take the disabilities of your fathers in earnest you cannot imagine how his letter pleased me
test0575,would it would it leave me and then i could believe i shall not always have occasion for it
test0576,my poor lady vavasar is carried to the tower and her great belly could not excuse her because she was acquainted by somebody that there was a plot against the protector and did not discover it
test0577,she has told now all that was told her but vows she will never say from whence she had it we shall see whether her resolutions are as unalterable as those of my lady talmash
test0578,i wonder how she behaved herself when she was married
test0579,i never saw any one yet that did not look simply and out of countenance nor ever knew a wedding well designed but one and that was of two persons where at time enough i confess to contrive
test0580,the truth is i could not endure to be mrs. bride in a public wedding to be made the happiest person on earth
test0581,do not take it ill for i would endure it if i could rather than fail but in earnest i do not think it were possible for me
test0582,yet in earnest your father will not find your brother pateon wanting in civility though he is not a man of much compliment unless it be in his letters to me nor an unreasonable person in anything
test0583,my aunt told me no longer gone than yesterday that i was the most willing woman that ever she knew and had an obstinacy of spirit nothing could overcome take heed
test0584,you see i give you fair warning
test0585,by the next i shall be gone to kent and my other journeys laid aside which i am not displeased at because it would have broken our intercourse very much
test0586,here are some verses of kaulies tell you how you like them
test0587,i told you in my last that my sullen journey was laid aside and that into kent hasten
test0588,if i drown by the way this will be my last letter and like a will i bequeath all my kindness to you in it with a charge never to besmirch it upon another mistress lest
test0589,indeed i like him extremely and he is commended to me by people that know him very well and are able to judge for a most excellent servant and faithful as possible
test0590,because you find fault with my other letters this is like to be shorter than they i did intend so though i can show you
test0591,i do not find it though i am told i was so extremely when i believed you loved me
test0592,but i am called upon
test0593,directed for your master
test0594,i see you can chid when you please and with authority but i deserve it i confess and all i can say for myself is that my fault proceeded from a very good principle in me
test0595,we dare not let our tongues lie more on one side of our mouth than the other for fear of overturning it
test0596,you are satisfied i hope at this that i have sunk down
test0597,but i am troubled much you should make so ill a journey to so little purpose indeed i read by the first post after my arrival here and cannot imagine how you came to miss of my letters
test0598,how welcome you will be but alas
test0599,for my life i cannot beat into their heads a passion that must be subject to no decay an even perfect kindness that must last perpetually without the least intermission
test0600,they laughed to hear me say that one unkind word would destroy all the satisfaction of my life and that i should expect our kindness should increase every day if it were possible but never less
test0601,we go abroad all day and play all night and say our prayers when we have time
test0602,well in sober earnestness now i would not lift us a twelve months to gain all that the king has lost unless it were to give him it again
test0603,will you be so good natured?
test0604,he has one son and it is the finest boy that ever you saw and has a noble spirit but yet stands in that awe of his father that one word from him is as much as twenty whipp
test0605,you must give me leave to entertain you with discourses of the family for i can tell you nothing else from hence
test0606,not to know when you would come home i can assure you nor for any other occasion of my own but with a cousin of mine that had long designed to make her sport with him and did not miss
test0607,in my life i never heard so ridiculous a discourse as he made us and no old woman who passes for a witch could have been more puzzled to seek what to say to reasonable people than he was
test0608,ever since this adventure i have had so great a belief in all things with this nature that i could not forbear laying a pease cord with nine pease inns under my door yesterday it was
test0609,she pulled her hair down turned her skirt back put her feet on the fender and took pottle to her lap all of which arrangements signify that something very important had got to be thought over and settled
test0610,the more proposals the more credit
test0611,i've tried it and liked it and maybe this is the consequence of that night's fun
test0612,just suppose it is true that he does ask me and i say yes
test0613,what a spiteful thing i am!
test0614,i could do so much for all at home how i should enjoy that
test0615,let us see how can i begin?
test0616,he has known her all her life and has a good influence over her.
test0617,now as polly was by no means a perfect creature i am free to confess that the old tedium assailed her more than once that week for when the first excitement of the dodging reform had
test0618,i don't think it was his wealth accomplishments or position that most attracted polly though these doubtless possessed the greater influence than she suspected
test0619,it was that indescribable something which women are quick to see and feel in men who have been blessed with wise and good mothers
test0620,this had a special charm to polly for she soon found that this side of his character was not shown to everyone
test0621,lately this had changed especially towards polly and it flattered her more than she would confess even to herself
test0622,at first she tried to think she could but unfortunately hearts are so contrary that they won't be obedient to reason will or even credulity
test0623,polly felt a very cordial friendship for mr sidney but not one particle of the love which is the only coin in which love can be truly paid
test0624,this finished polly's decision and after that night she never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant temptation which came in a guise particularly attractive to a young girl with the spy of the old eve in her
test0625,when saturday came polly started as usual for a visit to becky and bes but couldn't resist stopping at the shores to leave a little parcel for a fan though it was calling time
test0626,a foolish little speech to make to a dark but you see polly was only a tender-hearted girl trying to do her duty
test0627,take hold of master charles's hand miss maimy and walk pretty like willie flussey said the maid
test0628,at the street corner a black eyed school boy was parting from a rosy faced school girl whose music role he was reluctantly surrendering
test0629,how he got there was never very clear to polly but there he was flushed and a little out of breath but looking so glad to see her till she had not the heart to be stiff and cool
test0630,she really couldn't help it it was so pleasant to see him again just when she was feeling so lonely
test0631,"that is the way i get to the rousseau, said polly."
test0632,she did not mean to tell but his frankness was so agreeable she forgot herself
test0633,but i know her better and i assure you that she does improve she tries to mean her thoughts though she won't own it and will surprise you someday by the amount of heart and sense and goodness she
test0634,"thank you, no."
test0635,how lovely the park looks she said in great confusion
test0636,"asked the art for young men, laying a trap into which polly immediately fell."
test0637,he was quicker to take a hint than she had expected and being both proud and generous we sought to settle the matter at once for polly's sake as well as his own
test0638,so when she made her last benevolent remark he said quietly watching her face keenly all the while i thought so well i'm going out of town on business for several weeks so you can enjoy your
test0639,she thought she had a good deal of the coquettish in her and i have no doubt that with time and training she would have become a very dangerous little person but now she was far too
test0640,he was gone before she could do anything but look up at him with a remorseful face and she walked on feeling that the first and perhaps the only lover she would ever have had read his answer and
test0641,pilly did not return to her favourite walk till she learned for minnie that uncle had really left town and then she found that his friendly company and conversation was what had made the way so pleasant after
test0642,working two and four as usual what's the news with you?
test0643,perhaps shielded him
test0644,"utterly done with and laid upon the shelf,"
test0645,minnie said the other day she wished she was a pigeon so she could paddle in the paddles and not fuss about rabbits
test0646,now don't be affected polly but just tell me like a deer has not he proposed
test0647,don't you think he means to?
test0648,truly july fan.
test0649,"i don't mean to be prying, but i really thought he did."
test0650,well i always meant to try it if i got a chance and i have
test0651,i just gave him a hint and he took it.
test0652,he meant to go away before that so then think his heart is broken or mind what city tellers say
test0653,he understood and being a gentleman made no fuss.
test0654,but polly it would have been a grand thing for you
test0655,"i'm odd, you know i prefer to be an independent spinster and teach music all my days"
test0656,never mind what the business was it suffices to say that it was a good beginning for a young man like thom who having been born and bred in the most conservative class of the most conceited
test0657,fortunately every one was so busy with the necessary preparations that there was no time for romances of any sort and the four young people worked together as soberly and sensibly as if all sorts of emotions
test0658,pity that the end shall come so soon but the hour did its work and went its way leaving a clearer atmosphere behind but the young folk did not see it then for their ears were dim because of
test0659,if it had not been for two things i fear she never would have stood a summer in town but sidney often called to her vacation came and the voluminous correspondence with polly beguiled the
test0660,tum wrote once a week to his mother the letters were short and not very satisfactory for men never do tell the interesting little things that women best like to hear
test0661,now i am only tired had a good deal to do lately and the dull weather makes me just a travel brood.
test0662,"forgive me, polly. i can't help saying it for it's there and i want to be as true to you as you were to me if i can."
test0663,i tried not to deceive myself but it seems as if there was a chance of happiness for me.
test0664,thank heaven for that!
test0665,goadly with the hardest satisfaction in her voice.
test0666,"poor polly was so taken by surprise that she had not a word to say,"
test0667,none when needed she told her face entered for her as well as the impulse which made her hide her head in the sofa cushion like a foolish ostrich when the hands are after it.
test0668,once or twice but sort of jokingly and i thought it was only some little flotation.
test0669,it was so stupid of me not to guess before.
test0670,it was so tender earnest and defiant that fanny forgot the defence of her own lover in admiration of polly's loyalty to hers for this faithful all-absorbing love was a new revelation to
test0671,"i hope maria baily is only thinks her, she added softly for i could not bear to have him disappointed again."
test0672,"said fanny, turning hopeful all at once."
test0673,"suppose i say a word to dun, just inquire after his heart and a hair's breadth away, you know and give him a chance to tell me if there's anything to tell."
test0674,"bear it, people always do bear things somehow, and said polly, looking as if sentence had been passed upon her."
test0675,it was a very different window from the last for both the girls.
test0676,fanny wanted to show him what she could do toward making a pleasant home she certainly succeeded by than she suspected for in spite of many failures and discouragements behind the scenes the little house became a most
test0677,she kept much at home when the day's work was done finding it pleasant to sit dreaming of a book or sooner alone than to exert herself even to go to the shores.
test0678,polly was not at all like herself that windmill and those nearest to her saw and wondered at it most.
test0679,for net was so absorbed in business that he ignored the whole baley question and left them in other darkness.
test0680,then veny came walking in upon her one day looking as if she had brought tidings of such great joy that she hardly knew how to tell them.
test0681,but if work baskets were gifted with powers of speech they could tell stories more true and tender than any we read.
test0682,she had even been in society before the revolution
test0683,it was her pleasure and vanity to drag in these names on every pretext
test0684,every year she solemnly renewed her vows and at the moment of taking the oath she said to the priest monsieur saint francis gave it to monsieur saint julien monsieur saint
test0685,and the schoolgirls would begin to laugh not in their sleeves but under their veils charming little trifled laughs which made the vocal mother's frown
test0686,it was a century which spoke through her but it was the eighteen century
test0687,the rule of fountival did not forbid this
test0688,she would not show the object to any one
test0689,thus it furnished a subject of comment for all those who were on occupied or boarded in the convent
test0690,some unique chaplet some authentic relic
test0691,they lost themselves in conjectures
test0692,when the poor old woman died they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting perhaps and opened it
test0693,he is resisting fluttering his tiny wings and still making an effort to fly but the dancer is laughing with a satanic air
test0694,moral love conquered by the collyre
test0695,the priory returned and seated herself once more on her chair
test0696,we will present a sensational report of the dialogue which then ensued to the best of our ability
test0697,father forvent
test0698,reverend mother do you know the chapel
test0699,and you have been in the choir and pursuing of your duties three or four times
test0700,there is a stone to be raised heavy
test0701,the slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar
test0702,the slab which closes the vault yes
test0703,it would be a good thing to have two men for it
test0704,a woman is never a man
test0705,because dom mariale gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of saint bernard while merlino horseshoes only gives three hundred and sixty seven i do not despise merlino horseshoes
test0706,marriage consists in working according to one's strength a coxcomb is not a dockyard
test0707,and a woman is not a man but my brother is a strong one though
test0708,and can you get a keeper?
test0709,there is a ring in the stone
test0710,i will put the thread through it
test0711,that is good reverend mother i will open the vault
test0712,will that be all no?
test0713,"give me your orders, very reverend mother"
test0714,for that we have confidence in you
test0715,i am here to do anything you wish
test0716,and to hold your peace about everything yes reverend mother
test0717,where the vault is open i will close it again
test0718,but before that what reverend mother?
test0719,father forvent reverend mother
test0720,you know that your mother died this morning
test0721,no did you not hear the bell?
test0722,nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden really
test0723,and then the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning
test0724,it was mother's crucifixion
test0725,three years ago madame de pissenard a jesuit turned orthodox merely from having seen mother crucifixion at prayer ah
test0726,the mothers have taken her to the dead room which opens on the church i know
test0727,a fine sight it would be to see a man enter the deadroom more often.
test0728,hey more often?
test0729,what do you say?
test0730,i say more often more often than what
test0731,reverend mother i did not say more often than what i said more often
test0732,but i did not say more often.
test0733,at that moment nine o'clock struck
test0734,at nine in the morning and at all hours praised and adored to be the most holy sacrament of the altar said the priest
test0735,it cut more often short.
test0736,forlivan mopped his forehead
test0737,in her lifetime mother crucifixion made converts after her death she will perform miracles she will
test0738,fatherly venus the community has been blessed in mother's crucifixion
test0739,she retained her consciousness to the very last moment
test0740,she gave us her last commands
test0741,if you had a little more faith and if you could have been in her cell she would have cured her leg merely by touching it she smiled
test0742,there was something of paradise in that death
test0743,froulard thought that it was an orison which she was finishing
test0744,forswalt held his peace she went on
test0745,i have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastical laborers in our lord who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life and who bear wonderful fruit
test0746,fortunately the prius completely absorbed in her own thoughts did not hear it.
test0747,she continued further prevent
test0748,yes reverend mother
test0749,st. trinity bishop of port where the mouth of the tiber empties into the sea requested that on his tomb might be engraved the sign which was placed on the graves of parasites in the hope
test0750,the dead must be obeyed so be it
test0751,"for that matter no, reverend mother"
test0752,father before mother crucifixion will be interred in the coffin in which she has slept for the last twenty years that is just
test0753,it is a continuation of her slumber
test0754,so i shall have to nail up that coffin yes
test0755,i am at the orders of the very reverend community
test0756,the four mother presenters will assist you
test0757,no in lowering the coffin
test0758,where into the vault
test0759,foswell's started the vault under the altar
test0760,under the altar but
test0761,you will have an iron bar yes but
test0762,you will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring but
test0763,the dead must be obeyed to be buried in a vault under the altar of the chapel not to go to profane earth to remain there in death where she prayed while living such was the last wish
test0764,she asked it of us that is to say commanded us
test0765,but it is forbidden
test0766,oh i am a stone in your walls
test0767,think father for venus if she were to work miracles here
test0768,what a glory of god for the community and miracles issued from tombs
test0769,but reverend mother is the agent of the sanitary commission
test0770,but the commissary of police
test0771,shonodamar one of the seven german kings who entered among the galls under the empire of constans expressly recognized the right of nuns to be buried in religion that is to say beneath the
test0772,the world is nothing in the presence of the cross
test0773,martin the eleventh general of the carthaginians gave to his order this device staurus crew dumovulor orbis
test0774,the priory who is usually subject to the barrier of silence and whose reservoir was over full rose and exclaimed with the luctuosity of a dam which has broken
test0775,i have on my right benvolio and on my left bernard who was bernard
test0776,the first abbot of claverie
test0777,his order has produced forty popes two hundred cardinals fifty patriarchs sixteen hundred archbishops four thousand six hundred bishops three thousand six hundred canonized saints and has been in existence for fourteen hundred years
test0778,on one side st. bernard on the other the agent of the sanitary department
test0779,god subordinated to the commission of police such as the age silence forvah
test0780,no one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulchre
test0781,only fanatics and those in error deny it
test0782,we live in times of terrible confusion
test0783,we are ignorant and impes
test0784,and then religion is attacked why?
test0785,because there have been bad priests because sacagawea was a brother of saloon bishop of kempe was a brother of saloon bishop of emberton and because both of them followed mamal
test0786,they persecuted the saints
test0787,they shut their eyes to the truth darkness is the rule
test0788,the most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind
test0789,"oh, how wicked people are!"
test0790,by order of the king signifies to day by order of the revolution
test0791,one no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead a holy death is prohibited
test0792,guthier bishop of chalons held his own in this matter against otho duke of burgundy
test0793,the priory took breath then turned to foswal
test0794,you will close the coffin the sisters will carry it to the chapel.
test0795,the office for the dead will then be set
test0796,but she will hear she will not listen
test0797,besides what the cloister knows the world learns not.
test0798,a pause and suit
test0799,you will remove your bell.
test0800,has the doctor for the dead paid his visit?
test0801,he will pay four o'clock to-day
test0802,the peel which orders the doctor for the dead to be summoned has already been wrong.
test0803,but you do not understand any of the peels
test0804,that is well father prevent
test0805,where will you obtain it?
test0806,i have my heap of old iron at the bottom of the garden.
test0807,reverend mother what
test0808,if you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort my brother is the strong man for you a perfect turk
test0809,you will do it as fast as possible
test0810,i cannot work very fast i'm infirm that is why i require an assistant i limp
test0811,everything must have been completed a good quarter of an hour before that.
test0812,i will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community these are my orders i am to nail the coffin
test0813,at eleven o'clock exactly i am to be in the chapel.
test0814,mother ashington will be there two men would be better.
test0815,however never mind i shall have my lover.
test0816,after which there will be no trace of anything
test0817,the government will have no suspicion
test0818,the empty coffin remains this produced a pause
test0819,what is to be done with that coffin father?
test0820,it will be given to the earth empty
test0821,"ah, lady, exclaiming farsal,"
test0822,the veil stuck fast in his throat
test0823,he made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath
test0824,i will put earth in the coffin reverend mother that will produce the effect of a corpse
test0825,i will make that my special business
test0826,general observations on preserves confectionery ice and dessert dishes
test0827,the expense of preserving them with sugar is a serious objection for except sugar is used in considerable quantities the success is very uncertain
test0828,fruit gathered in wet or foggy weather will soon be milded and be of no service for preserves
test0829,but to distinguish these properly requires very great attention and considerable experience
test0830,if you dip the finger into the serp and apply to the thumb the tenacity of the serp will on separating the finger and thumb afford a thread which shortly breaks this is the little thread
test0831,let it boil up again and then take it off and remove carefully the scum that has risen
test0832,it is considered to be sufficiently boiled when some taken up in a spoon pours out like oil
test0833,before sugar was in use honey was employed to preserve many vegetable productions though this substance is now given to the juice of the sugar cane
test0834,fourteen ninety nine
test0835,boil them up three days successively skimming each time and they will then be finished and in a state fit to be put into pots for use
test0836,the reason why the fruit is emptied out of the preserving pan into an earthen pan is that the acid of the fruit acts upon the copper of which the preserving pans are usually made
test0837,from this example the process of preserving fruits by syrup would be easily comprehended
test0838,they should be dried in the stove or oven on a seive and turned every six or eight hours fresh powdered sugar being sifted over them every time they are turned
test0839,in this way it is also that orange and lemon chips are preserved
test0840,marmalades jams and fruit preserves are of the same nature and are now in very general quest
test0841,marmalades and jams differ little from each other their preserves of half liquid consistency made by boiling the pulp of fruits and sometimes part of the rinds with sugar
test0842,that they may keep it as necessary not to be sparing of sugar fifteenth o three
test0843,in all the operations for preserving making when the preserving pan is used it should not be placed on the fire but on a trivet unless the jam is made on a hot plate when this is not necessary
test0844,confectionery fifteenth o eight
test0845,in speaking of confectionery should be remarked that all the various preparations above named come strictly speaking under that head from the various fruits flowers herbs and roots and juices which when boiled with sugar were formally
test0846,the thousand and one ornate dishes that adorn the tables of the wealthy should be purchased from the confectioner and they cannot profitably be made at home
test0847,however as late as the reign of our two last georgians fabulous sums were often expended upon fanciful desserts
test0848,the shape of the dishes varies at different periods the prevailing fashion at present being oval and circular dishes on stems
test0849,ices
test0850,at desserts or at some evening parties ice is scarcely to be dispensed with
test0851,the splat is generally made of copper kept bright and clean
test0852,they should be taken immediately after the repast or some hours after because the taking of these substances during the process of digestion is apt to provoke indigestion
test0853,there was once a time a widow who had a son and a daughter by his first wife
test0854,from the very day that the new wife came into the house there was no peace for the men's children and not a corner to be found where they could get any rest so the boy thought that the
test0855,but his sister who was still at home feared worse and worse
test0856,kiss me girl said the head
test0857,when the king entered and saw him stood still as if he were in fetters and could not stir from the spot for the picture seen to him so beautiful
test0858,these promised to make all the haste he could and set forth from the king's palace
test0859,at last they came inside of land
test0860,well if my brother says so i must do it said the man's daughter and she flung her canvas into the sea
test0861,what is my brother saying asked his sister again
test0862,on the first thursday night after this a beautiful maiden came into the kitchen of the palace and begged the kitchen maid who slept there to lend her a brush
test0863,she begged very pritily and got it and then she brushed her hair and the gold dropped from it
test0864,out on the ugly bushy bride sleeping so soft by the young king's side on sand and stones my bed i make and my brother sleeps with a cold snake unpityd and unweep
test0865,i shall come twice more and then never again said she
test0866,this time also as before she borrowed a brush and brushed her hair with it and the gold dropped down as she did it and again she sent the dog out three times and when day dawned she departed
test0867,no one can tell how delighted the king was to get rid of that hideous bushy bride and get a queen who was bright and beautiful as her day itself
test0868,wilt not serve me and watch my seven fowls as the king
test0869,the youth thought that it was very easy work to watch the fowls and he could do it well enough
test0870,has watched faithfully and well the whole day long said the king when the lad came into his presence in the evening
test0871,yes that i have said the youth
test0872,he had gone out once to seek a place he said but never would he do such a thing again
test0873,then the king promised him the same punishment and the same reward that he had promised his brother
test0874,when he had run after the fools for a long long time and was hot and tired he passed by a cliff in the rock where an old woman was sitting spinning with the distaff and she called to
test0875,come hither my handsome son and let me comb your hair
test0876,the youth liked the thought of this let the fools run where they chose and seated himself in the cleft of the rock by the side of the old hag
test0877,so there he sat with his head on her lap taking ease the live long day
test0878,on the third day sidra wanted to set out
test0879,the two brothers laughed at him and his father and mother begged him not to go but all to no purpose and cinderlad set out on his way
test0880,i am walking about in search of a place at cinderlad
test0881,i would much rather have the princess said cinderlad
test0882,"and lest they journey downwards a long, long way"
test0883,when they had gone for a long long way the fool again asked dost thou see any thing now
test0884,yes now i see something that is white said cinderella
test0885,it looks like a chunk of a great thick birch tree
test0886,cinderella tried but could not do it so he had to take a draw from the pitcher and then one more and after that still another and then he was able to wield the sword with perfect ease
test0887,for we are brothers of the princess whom thou art to have when thou canst tell the king what we eat and drink but there is a mighty troll who casts a spell over us
test0888,"when they had traveled a long, long way the fool said doesst thou see anything?"
test0889,"and now inquireful, see that she's nothing now."
test0890,then now said the fair didst not see any thing now
test0891,that is a river said the fool and we have to cross it
test0892,"i have done my best, sir lad"
test0893,once upon a time there was a king in the north who had won many wars but now he was old
test0894,the old king went out and fought bravely but at last his sword broke and he was wounded and his men fled
test0895,but in the night when the battle was over his young wife came out and searched for him among the slain and at last she found him and asked whether he might be healed
test0896,so you asked the queen how do you know in the dark of night whether the hours are wearing to the morning and she said
test0897,then the old man said drive all the horses into the river and choose the one that swims across
test0898,he is no bigger than other dragons said the tutor and if you were as brave as your father you would not fear him
test0899,then the person who had killed otter went down and caught the dwarf who owned all the treasure and took it from him
test0900,only one ring was left which the dwarf war and even that was taken from him
test0901,reagan made a sword and siger tried it with a blow on a lump of iron and the sword broke
test0902,then sigrid went to his mother and asked for the broken pieces of his father's blade and gave them to regen
test0903,sicor said that sword would do
test0904,then he saw the track which the dragon had made when he went to a cliff to drink and the track was as if a great river had rolled along and left a deep valley
test0905,but sigurd waited till half of him had crawled over the pit and then he thrust the sword gram right into his very heart
test0906,sigrid said i would touch none of it if by losing it i should never die
test0907,but all men die and no brave man lets death frighten him from his desire
test0908,gave thee valfahfren and then valfahfren died
test0909,then sigurd rode back and met regin and regin asked him to roast fafen's heart and let him taste of it
test0910,sugarcane put the heart of fava bean on a steak and roasted it
test0911,there's sigurd roasting fafnir's heart for another when he should taste of it and learn all wisdom
test0912,"that let him do, then rode over hinnefeld to the place where brunhilde sleeps."
test0913,there must she sleep till thou comes for her waking rise up and ride for now sure she will swear the vow fearless of breaking
test0914,then he took the helmet off the head of the sleeper and behold she was the most beautiful lady
test0915,then seguidor went away and he came to the house of a king who had a fair daughter
test0916,lindbergh's father told gunner that she would marry none but him who could ride the flame in front of her enchanted tower and that they rode and gunner said his horse sat the flame
test0917,for one day when brendon and gundren were bathing brendon waited farthest out into the river and said she did that to show she was gundren superior
test0918,for her husband she said had ridden through the flame when no other man dared face it
test0919,not long to wait he said till the bitter sword stands fast in my heart and now will not live long when i am dead
test0920,lobsters and lobsters
test0921,when is a lobster not a lobster when is it a crayfish
test0922,this question and answer might well go into the primer of information for those who come to san francisco from the east for what is called a lobster in san francisco is not a lobster at all but
test0923,the pacific crayfish however serves every purpose and while many contend that its meat is not so delicately flavored as that of its eastern cousin the canadian will assert that it is better but of course something
test0924,a book would be written about this restaurant and then all would not be told for all its secrets can never be known
test0925,it was here that most magnificent dinners were arranged it was here that extraordinary dishes were concocted by chefs with worldwide fame it was here that lobster elaine neuberg reached its highest perfection and this
test0926,lobster ella newberg
test0927,one pound of lobster meat one teaspoonful of butter one half pint of cream yolks of four eggs one glass of sherry lobster fat
test0928,"put this in a double boiler and let cook until thick, stirring constantly."
test0929,serve in a chafing dish with thin slices of dry toast
test0930,king of shellfish
test0931,one has to come to san francisco to partake of the king of shellfish the mammoth pacific crab
test0932,i say come to san francisco advisingly for while the crab is found all along the coast it is prepared nowhere so deliciously as in san francisco
test0933,gobey's passed with the fire and the little restaurant bearing his name and in charge of his widow in union square avenue has not attained the fame of the old place
test0934,it is possible that she knows the secret of preparing crab as it was prepared in the go-byes of before the fire but his procured did not descend to her
test0935,gobies crab stew
test0936,take the meat of one large crab scraping out all the fat from the shell
test0937,soaked the crab meat in the sharer two hours before cooking
test0938,chopped fine the onion sweet pepper and tomato with the rosemary
test0939,heep this in a stew pan and when simmering add the sherry and crab meat and let all cook together with the slow fire for eight minutes
test0940,serve in a chafing dish with toasted crackers or thin slices of toasted bread
test0941,lobster in miniature
test0942,so far it has been used mostly for garnishing of other dishes and it is only recently that the hufbrow has been making a specialty of them

test0981,that's where the difficulty lies
test0982,it is easy enough with the child you will carry her out
test0983,and she will hold her thumb i answer for that
test0984,foux lavon grumbled more to himself than to jean valjean
test0985,you understand father madame the government will notice it

test0987,fuselush went on
test0988,it is to morrow the time to bring you in the priores expects you

test0997,frouville who was seated sprang up as though a bomb had burst under his chair you
test0998,you know french lavaine what you have said mother crucifixion is dead
test0999,and i add and father madeline is buried ar
test1000,"you are not like other men, father, mother,"
test1001,this offers the means but give me some information in the first place
test1002,how long is the coffin six feet
test1003,it is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening on the garden which is closed on the outside by a shutter and two doors one leads into the convent the other into the church of
test1004,the church in the street the church which any one can enter
test1005,have you the keys to those two doors
test1006,no no i have the key to the door which communicates with the convent the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church
test1007,only to allow the undertakers men to enter when they come to get the coffin
test1008,who nails up the coffin i do
test1009,who spreads the fall over it.
test1010,not another man except the police doctor can enter the deadroom that is even written on the wall

test1012,about three o'clock in the afternoon
test1013,i shall be hungry but i will bring you something
test1014,you can come and nail me up in the coffin at two o'clock
test1015,flossie lavalle re-coiled and cracked his finger joints but that is impossible
test1016,but impossible to take a hammer and drive some nails in a plank
test1017,jean valjean had been in worse straights than this
test1018,any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape
test1019,what does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure?
test1020,to have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bauble of goods to live for a long time in a box to find air where there is none to economise his breath for hours
test1021,you surely must have a gimlet you will make a few holes here and there around my mouth and you will nail the top plank loosely good and what if you should happen to cough or sneeze
test1022,a man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze
test1023,who is there who is not said to a cat do come in
test1024,the over prudent cats as they are and because they are cats sometimes incure more danger than the audacious
test1025,but jean valjean's kindness prevailed over him in spite of himself he grumbled
test1026,if you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right i am sure of getting you out of the grave
test1027,an old fellow of the old school the grave digger puts the corpses in the grave and i put the grave digger in my pocket
test1028,i shall follow that is my business.

test1033,on the following day as the sun was declining the very rare passes by on the boulevard du men pulled off their hats to an old fashioned hirs ornamented with skulls cross bones and tears
test1034,this hush contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross like a huge corpse with drooping arms
test1035,a morning coach in which could be seen a priest in his surplus and a choir boy in his red cap followed
test1036,behind it came an old man in the garments of a labourer who limped along
test1037,the grave diggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at night in winter in this cemetery they were subject to a special discipline
test1038,these gates therefore swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the invalid
test1039,dampness was invading it the flowers were desiring it
test1040,the bourgeoise did not care much about being buried in the vaucluse it hinted at poverty parchezasse if you please
test1041,to be buried in pachechas is equivalent to having furniture of mochagoni it is recognized as elegant
test1042,the interment of mother crucifixion in the vault under the altar the exit of cozette the introduction of jean valjean into the deadroom all had been executed without difficulty and there had
test1043,it is one of the faults which resemble a duty
test1044,the nuns had committed it not only without difficulty but even with the applause of their own consciences
test1045,in the cloister what is called the government is only an intermeddling with authority and interference which is always questionable
test1046,make as many laws as you please men but keep them for yourselves
test1047,a prince is nothing in the presence of a prince
test1048,vulcan limped along behind the hercules in a very contented frame of mind
test1049,jean valjean's composition was one of those powerful tranquillities which are contagious
test1050,what remained to be done was a mere nothing
test1051,he played with father mistein.
test1052,he did what he liked with him he made him dance according to his whim
test1053,the permission for interment must be exhibited.
test1054,he was a sort of laboring man who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a mattock under his arm
test1055,the man replied the grave digger
test1056,the grave digger yes
test1057,you i
test1058,farthest miss tennyson is the grave digger he was
test1059,frouville had expected anything but this that a grave digger could die
test1060,it is true nevertheless that grave diggers do die themselves
test1061,"he had hardly the strength to stummar,"
test1062,but he persisted feebly father misty is the grave digger
test1063,do you know who little father laurence is? he is a jug of red wine.
test1064,but you are a jolly fellow too
test1065,are you not comrade? we'll go and have a drink together presently.
test1066,the man replied
test1067,he limped more out of anxiety than from infirmity
test1068,the grave digger walked on in front of him
test1069,foux levaunched passed the unexpected klévez once more in review
test1070,foux levon who was illiterate but very sharp understood that he had to deal with a formidable species of man with a fine talker he muttered
test1071,"so, father, mister tennyson is dead."
test1072,the man replied completely.
test1073,the good god consulted his notebook which shows when the time is up it was father mestin's turn father mestin died
test1074,stammered fowl levan it is made
test1075,you are a peasant i am a parisian
test1076,for a while of thought i am lost
test1077,they were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small alley leading to the nun's corner
test1078,and he added with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well
test1079,fortunately the soil which was light and wet with the winter rains clodged the wheels and retired its speed
test1080,my father was a porter at the pritaniem town hall.
test1081,but he had reverses he had losses on change i was obliged to renounce the profession of author but i am still a public writer
test1082,so you are not a grave digger then
test1083,returned voux de laval clucking at this branch feebly as it was
test1084,here a remark becomes necessary
test1085,a fosse-laine whatever his anguish offered a drink but he did not explain himself on one point who was to pay
test1086,the grave digger went on with a superior smile
test1087,"one must eat,"
test1088,the duke comes every morning they will tell him when he comes that i am asleep and perhaps he will wait until i awake.
test1089,yes but if i should already ask for something what

test1092,i don't know how it is but it seems to me as if i do
test1093,now go i can't keep my eyes open.
test1094,it seemed to me as if this sleeping city belonged to me i searched my memory for the names of those whose happiness i had once envied and i could not recall one without finding myself the happier
test1095,education family feeling the sense of duty the family are strong sentinels but there are no sentinels so vigilant as not to be deceived by a girl of sixteen to whom nature but by the voice
test1096,the more a girl believes in goodness the more isley will give way if not to her lover at least to love for being without mistrust she is without force and to win her love is a triumph
test1097,then how surely must they desire the world which is hidden from them how surely must they find it tempting how surely must they listen to the first voice which comes to tell its secrets through their bars and bless
test1098,with them the body has worn out the soul the senses have burned up the heart dissipation has blunted the feelings
test1099,they love by profession and not by instinct.
test1100,when a creature who has all her past to reproach herself with is taken all at once by a profound sincere irrepressible love of which she had never felt herself capable when she has confessed her love
test1101,they know not what proof to give.
test1102,in order to disturb the laborers in the field was one day devoured by a wolf because those whom he had so often deceived no longer believed in his cries for help
test1103,this is the same with these unhappy women when they love seriously.
test1104,but when the man who inspires this redeeming love is great enough in soul to receive it without remembering the past when he gives himself up to it when in short he loves as he is loved this man
test1105,but to return to the first day of my liaison
test1106,"when i reached home, i was in a state of mad gaiety,"
test1107,the woman becomes the man's mistress and loves him.
test1108,how why?
test1109,my whole being was exalted into joy at the memory of the words we had exchanged during that first night.
test1110,here are my orders to-night at avondale
test1111,come during the third and trant
test1112,the boxes were filled one after another.
test1113,only one remains empty the stage box.
test1114,at the beginning of the third act i heard the door of the box on which my eyes had been almost constantly fixed open and marguerite appeared.
test1115,did she love me enough to believe that the more beautiful she looked the happier i should be?
test1116,what is the matter with you to-night said marguerite rising and coming to the back of the box and kissing me on the forehead
test1117,he should go to bed she replied with that ironic era which went so well with her delicate and witty face.
test1118,where at home
test1119,you still love me can you ask?
test1120,because you don't like seeing him
test1121,notwithstanding i was very unhappy all the rest of the evening and went away very sadly after having seen prudence the count and marigold get into the carriage which was waiting for them at the door
test1122,i have not come to hinder you from leaving paris.
test1123,you're in the way margaret but how?
test1124,"well, you might have had a woman here, said prudens and it would hardly have been amusing for her to see two more arrive."
test1125,during this remark maraghees looked at me attentively
test1126,"my dear prudence, i answered, he do not know what you are saying."
test1127,yes but besides not wishing to put you out i was sure that if you came as far as my door you would want to come up and as i could not let you i did not wish to let
test1128,because i am watched and the least suspicion might do me the greatest harm.
test1129,is that really the only reason?
test1130,if there were any other i would tell you for we are not to have any secrets from one another now.
test1131,"honestly, do you care for me a little a great deal"
test1132,i fancied for a moment that i might give myself that happiness for six months you will not have it you insisted on knowing the means
test1133,well good heavens the means were easy enough to guess
test1134,i listened and i gazed at marguerite with admiration.
test1135,when i thought that this marvelous creature whose feet i had once longed to kiss was willing to let me take my place in her thoughts my part in her life and that i was not yet content with
test1136,"truly, she continued we poor creatures of chance have fantastic desires and inconceivable loves."
test1137,we are not allowed to have hearts under the penalty of being hooted down and of ruining our credit.
test1138,"we no longer belong to ourselves,"
test1139,we stand first in their self-esteem last in their esteem.
test1140,"never do they give you advice which is not lucrative,"
test1141,it means little enough to them that we should have ten lovers extra as long as they get dresses or a bracelet out of them and that they can drive in our carriage from time to time or come to
test1142,such a man i found in the duke but the duke is old and the old age neither protects nor consoles
test1143,i thought i could accept the life which he offered me but what would you have?
test1144,"what i loved in you was not the man who was but the man who was going to be,"
test1145,margaret tired out with this long confession threw herself back on the sofa and to stifle a slight cough put up her handkerchief to her lips and from that to her eyes
test1146,margaret do with me as you will i am your slave your dog but in the name of heaven tear up the letter which i wrote to you and do not make me leave you tomorrow it would kill
test1147,margaret drew the letter from her bosom and handing it to me with a smile of infinite sweetness said
test1148,here it is i have brought it back.
test1149,i tore the letter into fragments and kissed with tears the hand that gave it to me
test1150,look here prudens! do you know what he wants? said margaret.
test1151,he wants you to forgive him.
test1152,one must have but he wants more than that what then?
test1153,i embraced margaret until she was almost stifled.
test1154,almost mr. buzzard grinn'd.
test1155,this sounded like another story.
test1156,he was curious about that black-headed cousin of all mr. buzzard very curious indeed.
test1157,"anyway, he would find out,"
test1158,please mister buzzard please tell us the story he bagged
test1159,now all mr. buzzard is naturally good-natured and accommodating and when peter bagged so hard he just couldn't find it in his heart to refuse.
test1160,way back in the days when grandpa buzzard had his little falling out with old king eagle and then flew so high he scorched the feathers off in his head he had a cousin did grandpa
test1161,like most no-count people he used to make a regular nuisance of himself poking his nose into everybody's business and never tending to his own.
test1162,wasn't anything going on that this trifling member of the buzzard family didn't find out about a medal in he could ask more questions than peter rabbit can and anybody that can do that has
test1163,everybody looked at peter and laughed.
test1164,so wei yuan sat on the chimney tops whenever all jack fox gets to straining down where he have no business
test1165,one day this no-count trifling cousin of grandpa buzzard get cold in his feet.
test1166,it was on a little old house a little old tumble-down house.
test1167,why he just stretched his full head as far down the chimney as he can and listen and listen.
test1168,"but he don't mind that,"
test1169,will you please speak a little louder? he hollered down the chimney just like that.
test1170,"yes, she said, she surely was prumb scared."
test1171,they like to choke that no one buzzes to death.
test1172,"when he gets home, he try and try to brush that suit off but it doesn't get into the skin and it stays there."
test1173,"a little sigh of satisfaction went round the circle of listeners,"

test1266,as i thought that this was due to some fault in the earth i wanted to make these first experiments before i undertook my perseus
test1267,when i saw that this bust came out sharp and clean i said at once to construct a little furnace in the workshop erected for me by the duke after my own plans and design in the house which the
test1268,it was an extremely difficult task and i was anxious to observe all the niceties of art which i had learned so that is to lapse into some error
test1269,"i, in my turn, feel the same desire and hope to play my part like them, therefore, my lord, give me the leave to go."
test1270,but beware of letting ben nello quit you rather boast upon him always more than he demands for if he goes into foreign parts his ignorance is so presumptuous that he is just the man to disgrace
test1271,i asked no further reward for my labors up to this time than the gracious favor of your most illustrious excellence
test1272,then i thanked him and said i had no greater desire than to show those envious folks that i had it in me to execute the promised work
test1273,i had better look to my conduct for it had come to his ears that i relied upon his favour to take in first one man and then another
test1274,i begged his most illustrious excellence to name a single person who i had ever taken in
test1275,i said my lord i thank you and beg you to condescend so far as to listen to four words it is true that he left me a pair of old scales two anvil and three little
test1276,georgio came for them as his health.
test1277,i hope to prove on what account that scoundrel tries to bring me into this grace
test1278,when he had heard this speech the duke rose up in anger and sent for bernardo who was forced to take flight as far as venice he and antonio landi with him
test1279,you would better put this to the proof and i will go at once to the bargello
test1280,i am willing to enter into competition with the ancients and feel able to surpass them for since those early days in which i made the medals of pope clément i have learned so much that i can
test1281,after several weeks were wasted and pierre would neither work nor put men to work on the place i made him give it back
test1282,among artists certain enraged sculptors laughed at me and called me the new sculptor
test1283,now i hope to show them that i am an old sculptor if god shall grant me the boon of finishing my peregrine for that noble piazza of his most illustrious excellence
test1284,having this excellent resolve in heart i reached my home
test1285,wilder was rather sere after the ladies had floated away from the scene and he drank his liquor doggedly
test1286,it was his fancy i suppose to revive certain sentimental relations which had it be once existed between him and miss lake and he was a person of that combative temperament that magnified an object in proportion as
test1287,the story of fridolin and witch's pretty outlines.
test1288,sit down beside me and i'll tell you the story.
test1289,he sisted at it but took no part and in fact was listening to that other conversation which sounded with its pleasant gabble and laughter like a little musical tinkle of bells in the distance
test1290,but honest mark forgot that young ladies do not always come out quite alone and jump unassisted into their vehicles
test1291,but the middle sun was little in lauren he was neither dark nor fair he was neither handsome nor strong
test1292,throwing himself on his knees before the king he cried oh royal sire boast upon me also a sword and a steed that i may up and away to follow my brethren
test1293,but the king laughed him to scorn thou a sword he quoth
test1294,in sooth thou shalt have one but it shall be one befitting thy maidenly size and courage so small a weapon can be found in all my kingdom
test1295,fourth with the grinning gesture began shrieking with laughter so that the bells upon his mottled cap were all set to jangling
test1296,i did but laugh to think that the sword of ethelred had been so quickly found replied the gesture and he pointed to the swords hanging from the tailer's girdle
test1297,one night as he lay in a deep forest too unhappy to sleep he heard a noise near at hand in the bushes
test1298,thou shalt have thy liberty he cried even though thou shalt run me in peace the moment thou art free thou shalt be free
test1299,it had suddenly disappeared and in its place stood a beautiful fairy with filmy wings that shone like rainbows in the moonlight
test1300,at this moment there was a distant rumbling as thunder tis the ogre cried the fairy we must hasten
test1301,swords grow a giant's height and save us from the ogre's might.
test1302,he could see the oar standing powerless to hurt him on the other side of the cataract and nashing his teeth each one of which was as big as a millstone
test1303,the sight was so terrible that he turned on his heel and fled away as fast as his feet could carry him
test1304,thou shalt not be left a prisoner in this dismal spot while i have the power to help thee
test1305,he lifted the scissors and with one stroke destroyed the web and gave the fliers to him
test1306,a faint gleam of light on the opposite wall shows me the keyhole.
test1307,the prince spent all the following time until midnight trying to think of a suitable verse to say to the scissors
test1308,as he uttered the words the scissors leaped down of his hand and began to cut through the wooden shutters as easily as through cheese
test1309,in a very short time the prints and crawled through the opening
test1310,while he stood looking around him in bewilderment a firefly alighted on his arm flashing its little lantern in the prince's face it cried this way my friend the fly sent me to guide you
test1311,what has to become of me cried the poor peasant
test1312,my grain must fall and rot in the field from over-ripeness because i have not the strength to rise and harvest it then indeed must we all starve.
test1313,the grand dame whom he supplied with faggots the merchant whom he rescued from robbers the king's counsellor to whom he gave aid all became his friends up and down the land to beg
test1314,to him who could bring her back to her father's castle should be given the throne and kingdom as well as the princess herself so from far and near indeed from almost every country under the sun came knights
test1315,among those who drew back were ethelred's brothers the three that were dark and the three that were fair
test1316,athelred he did not their taunts
test1317,so they all cried out long and loud long live the prince prince is all.
test1318,he felt what the earth may possibly feel at the moment when it is torn open with the iron in order that grain may be deposited within it feels only the wound the quiver of the germ the joy
test1319,he had but just acquired a faith must he then reject it already?
test1320,he affirmed to himself that he would not he declared to himself that he would not doubt and he began to doubt in spite of himself
test1321,to stand between two religions from one of which you have not as yet emerged and another into which you have not yet entered is intolerable and twilight is pleasing only to bat-like souls
test1322,marius was clear-eyed and he required the true light.
test1323,the half lights of doubt painted him
test1324,whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was he could not halt there he was irresistibly constrained to continue to advance to examine to think to march further
test1325,he feared after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father to now take a step which should estrange him from that father
test1326,his discomfort was augmented by all the reflections which occurred to him
test1327,in the troubled state of his conscience he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence
test1328,they soon elbowed him abruptly
test1329,request kofar to come and talk with me said mariah.
test1330,what is to become of you? said currafix.
test1331,what are you going to do i do not know
test1332,silver gold here it is.
test1333,you will then have only a pair of trousers a west coat a hat and a coat and my boots
test1334,that will be enough.
test1335,"no, it is not good. what will you do after that?"
test1336,do you know german no?
test1337,it is badly paid work but one can live by it
test1338,the clothes dealer was sent for.
test1339,he paid twenty francs for the cast-off garments they went to the watchmakers.
test1340,he bought the watch for forty five francs
test1341,"hello, i'd forgotten that, said maria."
test1342,the landlord presented his bill which had to be paid on the spot
test1343,"i have ten francs left, said marie."
test1344,that will be swallowing a tongue very fast or a hundred sue very slowly
test1345,one morning on his return from the law school maria found a letter from his aunt and the sixty pistol that is to say six hundred francs and gold in a sealed box
test1346,marius sent back the thirteenth lyre to his aunt with the respectful letter in which he stated that he had sufficient means of subsistence and that he should be able to lend his needs
test1347,at that moment he had three franks left
test1348,he perceived that it was no good talking to the old men and that the principal person in the house was the mother
test1349,before her he decided to scatter her pearls
test1350,the princess was distracted and did not know what to do she felt she had sent against kitty
test1351,well doctor decide our fate said the princess tell me everything
test1352,is there hope she meant to say but her lips quivered and she could not utter the question well doctor
test1353,as you please the princess went out with a sigh
test1354,the family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his observations
test1355,and there are indications malnutrition nervous excitability and so on
test1356,the question stands thus in presence of indications of tuberculosis process what is to be done to maintain nutrition
test1357,yes that's an understood thing responded the celebrated physician again glancing at his watch
test1358,peggy is sorry if the yozei's bridge is not yet or shall i drive around
test1359,he asked ah it is
test1360,well then i can then do it in twenty minutes
test1361,and how about a tour abroad asked the family doctor
test1362,what is wanted is the means of improving nutrition and not for lowering it
test1363,the family doctor listened attentively and respectfully
test1364,but in favour of foreign travel i would urge the change of habits the removal from conditions calling up remissances
test1365,and then the mother wishes it he said
test1366,ah well in that case to let them go only those gnomes are mischievous
test1367,oh times are up already and he went to the door
test1368,the celebrated doctor announced to the princess a feeling of what was due from him dictated his doing so that he ought to see the patient once more
test1369,oh no only a few details princess come this way
test1370,and the mother accompanied by the doctor went into the drawing room to kitty
test1371,when the doctor came in she flushed crimson and her eyes filled with tears
test1372,she answered him and all at once got up furious
test1373,excuse me doctor but there is really no object in this
test1374,this is the third time you've asked me the same thing
test1375,the celebrated doctor did not take offense
test1376,nervous irritability he said to the princess when kitty had left the room however i had finished
test1377,and the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess as an exceptionally intelligent woman the condition of the young princess and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters which were certainly harmless
test1378,at the question should they go abroad the doctor punged into deep meditation as though resolving a weighty problem
test1379,finally his decision was pronounced they went to abroad but to put no faith in foreign quacks and to apply him in any need
test1380,it seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the doctor had gone
test1381,the mother was much more cheerful when she went back to her daughter and kitty pretended to be more cheerful
test1382,educated people of the upper classes are trying to stifle the ever growing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social order
test1383,this is absolutely incorrect
test1384,in the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interest for the interest of the group
test1385,the champions of the social conception of life usually try to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea of moral influence but this connection is quite impossible
test1386,the man who is controlled by moral influence acts in accordance with his own desires
test1387,the basis of authority is bodily violence
test1388,the possibility of applying bodily violence to the people is provided above by an organization of armed men trained to act in union and submission to one will
test1389,these bands of armed men submissive to a single will are what constitute the army
test1390,the army has always been and still is the basis of power
test1391,power is always in the hands of those who control the army and an all men power from the roman cesars to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their army than in anything and
test1392,indeed it could not be otherwise
test1393,only under those conditions could the social organization be justified
test1394,but since this is not the case and on the contrary men are power always far from being saints through the very fact of their possession of power the social organization based on power has no justification
test1395,even if there was once a time when owing to the low standards of morals and the disposition of men to violence the existence of an authority to restrain such violence was an advantage because the violence of the government
test1396,between the members of one state subject to a single authority the strife between the individuals seemed still less and the life of the state seems even more secure
test1397,it was produced on one hand by the natural growth of population and on the other by struggle and conquest
test1398,after conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to internal dissensions and so the state conception of life justifies itself
test1399,but this justification is never more than temporary
test1400,internal dissensions disappeared only in proportion to the degree of oppression exerted by the authority over the dissident individuals
test1401,government authority even if it does suppress private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the government
test1402,and therefore the oppression of the oppressed always goes on growing up to the furthest limit beyond which it cannot go without killing the goose with the golden egg
test1403,the most convincing example of this is to be found in the condition of the working classes of our epoch who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient time subdued by conquest
test1404,so it has always been
test1405,footnote the fact that in america the beacons of authority exist in spite of a small number of their troops not only fails to disprove this position but positively confirms it
test1406,the upper classes know that an army of fifty thousand will soon be insufficient and no longer relying on pincers men they feel that the security of their position depends on the increased strength of the army
test1407,the reason to which he gave expression is essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the pope engage with swiss guards and makes the russians of today so carefully distribute the recruits so that
test1408,the meaning of kapirov speech put in plain language is that funds are needed not to resist foreign foes but to buy under officers to be ready to act against the enslaved masses
test1409,and this abnormal order of things is maintained by the army
test1410,but there is not only one government there are other governments exploiting their subjects by violence in the same way and are always ready to pounce down on any other government and carry off the fruits of the to
test1411,and so every government needs an army also to protect its booty from its brigands
test1412,this increase is contagious as montsuke pointed out a hundred fifty years ago
test1413,every increase in the army of one state with the aim of self defence against its subjects becomes a source of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies
test1414,the despoticism of a government always increases with the strength of the army and its external successes and the aggressiveness of a government increases with its internal despoticism
test1415,the rivalry of the european states in constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse to universal military service since by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers is obtained at the least possible
test1416,and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the inequities practiced upon them all citizens have become their own impressors
test1417,this inconsistency has become obvious in universal military service
test1418,in fact the whole significance of the social conception of life consists in man's recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transitoriness of personal life itself and the transference of the aim
test1419,but with universal military service it comes to pass that men after making every sacrifice to get rid of the cruelty of strife and the insecurity of existence are called upon to face all the perils they had meant
test1420,but instead of doing that they exposed the individuals to the same necessity of strife substituting strife with individuals of other states for strife with neighbors
test1421,the taxes are raised from the people for war preparations absorb the greater part of the produce of labor which the army ought to defend
test1422,the danger of war ever ready to break renders all reforms of life social life vain and fruitless
test1423,but the fatal significance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent in the social conception of life is not only apparent in that
test1424,governments assert that armies are needed above all for external defense but that is not true
test1425,they are needed principally against their subjects and every man under military service becomes an accomplice in all the acts of violence of the government against the citizens without any choice of his own
test1426,and for the sake of what am i making them
test1427,i am expected for the sake of a state to make these sacrifices to renounce everything that can be precious to man peace family security and human dignity
test1428,except with the state they say we should be exposed to the attacks of evil disposed persons in our own country
test1429,we now know that threats and punishments cannot diminish their number that can only be done by change of environment and moral influence
test1430,so that the justification of state violence on the ground of the protection that gives us evil disposed persons even if it had some foundation three or four centuries ago has none whatever
test1431,except for the state they tell us we should not have any religion education culture of means of communication and so on
test1432,without the state men would not have been able to form the social institutions needed for doing anything
test1433,this argument too was well founded only some centuries ago
test1434,the great extension of means of communication and interchange of ideas has made men completely able to dispense with state aid informing societies associations corporations and congresses for scientific economic and political objects
test1435,without governments nations would be enslaved by their neighbors
test1436,the government they tell us with its army is necessary to defend us from neighboring states that might slay us
test1437,and if defense against barbarian nations is meant one thousand part of the troops now under arms is ample sufficient for that purpose
test1438,the power of the state far from being a security against the attacks of our neighbors exposes us on the contrary to much greater danger of such attacks
test1439,even looking at it practically wang that is to say all the burdens laid on him by the state no man can fail to see that for him personally to comply with the state demands and serve in the army
test1440,to resist would need independent thought and effort of which every man is not capable
test1441,so much for the advantages and disadvantages of both lines of conduct for a man of a wealthy class an oppressor
test1442,for a man of the poor working class the advantages and disadvantages will be the same but with a great increase of disadvantages
test1443,say you know something?
test1444,kris looked from a nickel plated flashlight to a car jack and spark plug
test1445,know who needs a job ban that's jay kearris
test1446,"okay, you said."
test1447,only why didn't you ask them yourself?
test1448,mike became uneasy and fished it in an elastic band out of his pocket made a flick of paper and sent it soaring into em street
test1449,well he admitted i did.
test1450,chris asked and for the first time that day the heavy weight he carried within him lifted and lightened little.
test1451,"think he really needs it, he pursued."
test1452,he would have liked to get the job for jake who needed it but somehow the task of facing mister whicker especially now that the light was going and dusk edged into the streets was not what
test1453,mike's expression changed to what once was to one of triumph but gries was only partially encouraged
test1454,bet you ain't goin' after all turnin' down him
test1455,mike was standing on the corner.
test1456,"aw, shocks!"
test1457,chris started off once more passing a bleak little victorian church perched on the hill above mister worker's house
test1458,an empty lot cut into by church lane gave a look of isolation to the ell shaped brick building that served mister whicker both house and place of business
test1459,the longer wing toward the back got a back door that opened on a water street the space between the house and san francisco avenue had been made into a neat oblong flower garden fenced off from the
test1460,a livid yellow stained the horizon beyond the factories and glacial clouds lowered and tumbled above.
test1461,the air was growing chill and chris decided to finish the job.
test1462,all at once you wondered how his mother was and everything in him impinged and tightened itself.
test1463,at the foot of the hill he reached the house
test1464,there were three things that always caught his eye amid the litter of dusty pieces
test1465,"on the left the coil of rope in the centre the model of a sailing ship in a green glass bottle and on the right the wooden statue of a negro boy and baggy trousers, turkish jacket"
test1466,but the name still showed at the prow and many a time chris safe at home and bed sailed imaginary voyages in the mirabel bell.
test1467,"he had never seen any one go into mr. worker's shop, now he thought of it."
test1468,how then did he live and what did he ever sell?
test1469,a sudden car horn and walked from this dream.
test1470,"of many times he had examined mr. wicker's window and poured over the rope, the ship and the nubian boy he had never gone into mr. wicker's shop."
test1471,so now alone until someone should answer the bell they looked eagerly if uneasily around him
test1472,what with the one window in the lower end of the day outside the long narrow shop was somber
test1473,heavy hand yeun and beams crossed it from one side to the other.
test1474,zucker's back being toward the source of light chris could not see his face
test1475,the double fans amid minute wrinkles breaking from eye corner to temple and joining with those over the cheekbones were drawn into the horizontal lines across the domed forehead
test1476,little tuffs of white fuzz above the ears were all that remained of the antiquarian's hair but what drew and held chris's gaze were the old man's eyes
test1477,chris blinked and looked again yes they were still there
test1478,chris swallowed and his voice came back to him
test1479,"yes sir, you said."
test1480,i saw your sign and i know a boy who needs the job.
test1481,"he's a school-made mine,"
test1482,jacky harris's name is and he really needs the job.
test1483,i i just wondered if the place was still open
test1484,what he saw was a fresh cheeked lad tall for thirteen sturdy with sincerity and good humor in his face and something sensitive and appealing about his eyes
test1485,he guessed there must be a lively fire in that room beyond.
test1486,would that interfere with jake's getting the job sir?
test1487,but even as he slowly turned the thought pierced his mind why did he not see the reflection of the headlights of the cars moving up around the corner of wall street not the hill toward the diaph
test1488,the rooms seemed overly still
test1489,then in that second he turned and faced about
test1490,the wide bower window was there before him three objects he liked best showing frosty and the moonlight that poured in from across the water
test1491,across the water where was the ferry
test1492,it was no longer there nor were the high walls and smokestacks of factories to be seen
test1493,the warehouses were still there.
test1494,flabbergasted and breathless chris was unaware that he had moved closer to peep out the window in every direction
test1495,no electric signs no lamp posts streets.
test1496,where the people's drug store stood but half an hour before rose the roof of what was evidently an inn
test1497,a courtyard was first lit by flaring torches two showing the swinging sign hung on a post
test1498,the post was planted at the edge of what was now a broad and money road
test1499,a coach with its top piled high with luggage stamped to halt beside the flagged court yard
test1500,they moved into the inn the coach rattled off to the stable.
test1501,my window has a power for those few who are to see.
test1502,the learning of magic was by no means easy
test1503,he told his master at once about simon gossler his herd of money and his hiding places for it
test1504,chris therefore threw himself into all the preliminaries of his task
test1505,one afternoon when he had returned after arrest to mr wicker's study he saw that there was something new in the room a bowl with a goldfish in it stood on the table but mr wicker
test1506,what did i all do first?
test1507,how have you improved my boy he exclaimed is now a time for you to try and this is as good a chance as any
test1508,suppose i change and can't change back
test1509,mr. wicker waited patiently beside him for a few moments for christ to get up and his courage
test1510,then nothing happened with a voice like a whip mr. wright said start it once
test1511,a sensation spread faster and faster
test1512,his head swam and he felt faint and a little sick but he persisted through the final words
test1513,he thought not without a feeling of pride and commenced experimenting with his tail and fins with such enthusiasm and delight that some little time elapsed before mr. whicker's voice boomed booms by
test1514,seventy four book one the return.
test1515,the figure shoes carved in some eastern style at curved down pointing toes
test1516,then all that once the idea came to chris.
test1517,"if he was to be a magician, could he make this boy come to life?"
test1518,he sprang on his haunches examined the carved wood and figure attentively and felt convinced that once alive the boy would be an ideal and happy companion
test1519,but how did one a change innate to animate?
test1520,gris got up and stole back to mr. worker's door.
test1521,you heard that magician going up the spiral staircase to his room above and after changing himself to a mouse to slip under the door and see that the room was real empty mister doom's proper shape and
test1522,the afternoon raining before increased in storm
test1523,thus came two hours before its time thunder snarls in the sky
test1524,certain elements were to be mixed and poured at the proper time
test1525,mr. worker began moving about upstairs the floorboards creaked quake quake and still chris could not leave until the potion fumed and glowed
test1526,with infinite caution chris closed the doors silently behind him and running lightly forward greeted the figure of the negro boy
test1527,it was as if the stiffness melted
test1528,under his eyes whettholds of cloth became rich silk embroidery gleamed in its reality upon the coat and oh the face
test1529,the wooden grin loosened the large eyes turned the hand holding the hard box of carved flowers moved then the bouquet fall
test1530,they went down to their quarters first
test1531,guess mister finney went to his quarters i don't remember seeing him cross the deck or come over that way at all
test1532,next ned silly was relaying him to the helm by elbert jones who took over ned went on down
test1533,it looks to me as if it could have been one of several people and i'll be switched if i know who i'll keep my eyes open
test1534,the mirabel bell was nearing heathen
test1535,we've water in fresh stalls to tick on there
test1536,chris lost no time as soon as he could do it without being noticed in hurrying down to his cabin
test1537,certainly my boy boomed the captain his blue eyes abruptly keen in penetrating
test1538,mister vinny will be some time on deck we cannot be other than heard in here
test1539,his face froze with nervousness that this might do not as an answer and he stood stiff and still before captain lizard
test1540,the captain sat forward in his chair looking at him for a long moment considering
test1541,then he said well i do not care for it i cannot say i do
test1542,this ship is more to me than wife or mother or family
test1543,and paused fingering his lower lip looking sideways in a reflective fashion at chris standing before him
test1544,we shall say no more but i trust you understand the responsibility you have.
test1545,the ship its cargo and its men will be in your hands
test1546,yes sir i think i can do it safely or i should not try sir
test1547,captain blizzard's round pink face crested in its winning smile.
test1548,he then went on to describe what else was to follow the covering of the ship with leaves to make it blend with its surroundings
test1549,camouflage was not a word the captain or any one else of his time had yet understood
test1550,what can be said during that time sir chris thought not ask
test1551,i am somewhat skilled in medicine i have to be as a captain of ship and crew know it
test1552,i shall say that you are in my own cabin so that i can care for you
test1553,not since he had left mister rooker and chris felt such confidence as he did in the words and actions of captain blizzard
test1554,he knew now that his absence for as long as he had to be away would be covered up and satisfactorily accounted for
test1555,their conversation had taken some little while.
test1556,in churchyards young
test1557,i knew well enough that he might be carried thousands of miles in the box car locked in perhaps without water or food
test1558,i am sure i kissed lady and i've had terrible moments since when i seem to remember kissing mr james two in the excitement
test1559,fortunately wonner of the detective were keeping bachelor hall in lodgings
test1560,out of deference to lydia they washed their dishes once a day and a concocted queer messes according to their several abilities

test1567,linnie was sleeping the sleep of the just when i went upstairs and i hunted out my things cautiously
test1568,they were chucking confidently together but when i came down they ceased
test1569,there were a few preparations to be made the logs to be gone over winters to be instructed as renewed vigilance and then after extinguishing the hall light we crept in the darkness through the front door
test1570,i ask no questions
test1571,once only somebody spoke and then it was an epitaph with a profanity from dr. steuart when he ran into a wire fence
test1572,i already know what i expected
test1573,the doctor was puffing somewhat when we finally came to a halt
test1574,i confess that just at that minute even sunniest side seemed a cheerful spot
test1575,in spite of myself i drew my breath sharply
test1576,it was alex armed with two long handled spades
test1577,the doctor kept a keen lookout but no one appeared
test1578,there is one thing sure i will not be suspected of complacency

test1596,yes yes

test1609,the key of my desk in fact was at that moment in the lock and the others were attached to it
test1610,now then sneered he we must have a confiscation of property
test1611,and putting the keys into his pocket he walked into the library
test1612,that and all replied master and the things were cleared away

test1621,here benson entered the candles and there followed the brief interval of silence i sat still in my chair and he was standing with his back to the fire silently trying thing in my despair
test1622,i know that day after day such feelings return upon me
test1623,i tried to look to him and raise my heart to heaven but it will cleave to the dust

test1640,it followed me into the library
test1641,i sought horton into his hands two of millicent's letters one dated from london and written during one of his worst seasons of reckless dissipation the other in the country during a lucid interval
test1642,the former was full of trouble and anguish not accusing him but deeply regretting his connection with his professed companions abusing mr grimesby and others insinuating bitter things against mr huntington and
test1643,i've been a cursed rascal god knows said he as he gave it an erty squeeze but you see if i don't make a man for it then meet me if i don't

test1651,after that they would prepare to their country home
test1652,captain lee did not look at all like london danby and now.
test1653,there was a very natural savagery and dejection there and a wild lere in his yellow eyes rachel sat down.
test1654,"a slave only think a slave,"
test1655,"oh, frightful! frightful! is it a dream?"
test1656,"oh, frightful! frightful!"
test1657,stanley stanley it would be mercy to kill me she broke her again.
test1658,bright and natty at the gin curtains and the little toilet set out not in elegantly and her pet piping gold fringe asleep on his perch with this bit of sugar between the wires of his cage her
test1659,when he came back to the drawing-room a toilet-bottle of over-the-clone in his hand with her lace handkerchief he bathed her temples in forehead.
test1660,"there was nothing very brotherly in his look as he purred into a pale, sharp-cheeked face during the process."
test1661,"there, don't mind me, she said sharply and getting up she looked down at her dress and thin shoes and seeming to recollect herself she took the candle he had just set down and went swiftly"
test1662,and she threw back her veil and going hurriedly to the toilet mechanically surveyed herself in the glass.
test1663,"rachel lee, rachel lee, what are you now?"
test1664,i'll stay here that is in the drawing room she answered and the face was withdrawn.
test1665,he slackened his pace and tapped sharply at the little window of the muddiest post office at which the young ladies in the pony carriage had pulled up the day before and within which lewq
test1666,lucy took care of mr. larkan's dogs and groomed mr. wilder's horse and cleaned up his dog cart for mark being clothes about money and finding that the thing was to be

test1668,here where the flow of soul and stout long pipes long yarns and tolerably long credits and the humble chapels of the town resorted to thither for the pleasures of a club life and often
test1669,lost no time and i'll give you half a crown.
test1670,lucy stoke's home is cozy wide awake and in a few minutes more the door cut was trundled out into the lane and the horse harness went between the shafts with that wonderful cheer
test1671,"if i thought i'd failed you now, tamar, i should never come back goodnight, tamar."
test1672,the act said that in case of difference of opinion there must be a ballot
test1673,he went up to the table and striking it with his finger-ring he shouted loudly a ballad
test1674,he was shouting for the very coarse sir george evinham had proposed but it was evident that he hated him and all his party and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and roused
test1675,shouts were raised and for a moment all was confusion so that the marshal of the province had to call for order a ballot
test1676,we shed our blood for our country.
test1677,the confidence of the monarch no checking the accounts of the marshal he is not a cashier but that's not the point
test1678,"votes please, please,"
test1679,they expressed the most implacable hatred
test1680,levin did not in the least understand what was a matter and he marveled at the passion with which it was disputed whether or not the decision about flareof should be put to the vote
test1681,he forgot as sir jevenovitch explained to him afterwards this chivalry that it was necessary for the public good to get rid of the marshal of the province that to get rid of the marshal
test1682,but levin forgot all that and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons for whom he had a respect in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement
test1683,to escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the fresher's bar
test1684,he particularly liked the way one grey whiskered waiter who showed his corn for the other younger ones and was girt at by them was teaching them how to fold up napkins properly
test1685,living in advance but utterly forgetting what he was to do and much embarrassed he turned to sergei evanovich with the question where am i to put it
test1686,says even a bit brown
test1687,that is a matter for each man's decision he said severely
test1688,having put it in he re collected that he ought to have thrust his left hand too and so he thrust it in though too late and still more overcome with confusion he beat a hasty retreat into the
test1689,a hundred and twenty secs for admission ninety eight against
test1690,sang after the voice of the secretary who could not pronounce the letter r
test1691,then there was a laugh a button and two notches were found in the box
test1692,but the old party did not consider themselves conquered.
test1693,in reply santekov spoke of the trust the noblemen of the province had placed in him the affections they had shown him which he did not deserve as his only merit had been his attachment to
test1694,this expression in the marshall's face was particularly touching to levon because only the day before he had been at his house about his trusty business and had seen him in all his grandeur a
test1695,if there are men younger and more deserving than i let them serve
test1696,and the marshal disappeared through a side door
test1697,they were to proceed immediately to the election.
test1698,two noble gentlemen who had a weakness for strong drink had been made drunk by the partisans of snektov and a third had been robbed of his uniform.
test1699,on learning this the new party had made haste during the dispute about flurro to send some of their men in a sleigh to clothe the stripped gentlemen and to bring along one of the intoxicated
test1700,levin did not care to eat and he was not smoking he did not want to join his own friends that is sarah eivanovitch stepan arkinovich svyatsky and the
test1701,he went to the window and sat down scanning the groups and listening to what was being said around him
test1702,he's such a blank god.
test1703,i have told him so but it makes no difference only think of it
test1704,these persons were unmistakably seeking a place where they could talk without being overheard
test1705,shall we go on your excellence fine champagne
test1706,last year at our district marshal nicola evanoviches
test1707,oh still just the same always at a loss the landowner answered with a resigned smile but with an expression of serenity and conviction that so it must be
test1708,why? what is there to understand?
test1709,there is no meaning in it at all
test1710,then two one keep up communications
test1711,it's a moral obligation of assart
test1712,and then to tell the truth there is one's own interest
test1713,they are proprietors of a sort but we are the landowners
test1714,that it may be but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully
test1715,if we are laying out a garden planning one before the house you know and there you have a tree that stood centuries in the very spot old and nalled may it be and yet you don't cut
test1716,well and how is your land doing
test1717,but one's work is thrown in for nothing
test1718,oh well one does it what would you have
test1719,and what's more the landlord went on leaning his elbows on the window and chatting on my son i must tell you has no taste for it
test1720,so there will be no one to keep it up and yet one does it
test1721,we walked about the fields and the garden no sirrah stephan levesque everything's well looked after but your gardens neglected
test1722,to my thinking i'd cut down the line tree
test1723,here you have thousands of limes and each would make two good bundles of bark
test1724,you're married i heard said the landowner
test1725,"yes, it's rather strange. he went on."
test1726,the landlord chockled under his white moustaches
test1727,why don't we cut down our parks for timber?
test1728,said eleven returning to a thought that rudd struck him
test1729,there is a class instinct too of what one ought and ought not to do
test1730,there's the peasants too i wonder at them sometimes any good peasant tries to take all the land he can
test1731,without a return to add a simple loss
test1732,when he came from the bath proclus visited him again
test1733,but harmon was not in the mood to share a joyous revel and he frankly said so although immediately after his return he had accepted the invitation to the festival which the whole fellowship of artists would give
test1734,she would appear herself at dessert and the banquet must therefore begin at an unusually early hour
test1735,so the artist found himself obliged to relinquish his opposition
test1736,the banquet was to begin in a few hours yet he could not let the day pass without seeing daphne and telling her the words of the oracle
test1737,he longed with ardent yearning for the sound of her voice and still more to unburden his sorely troubled soul to her
test1738,since his return from the oracle the fear that the rescue demeter might yet be the work of mercurius had again mastered him
test1739,the approval as well as the doubts which had arisen in others strengthened his opinion although even now he could not succeed in bringing it into harmony with the facts
test1740,then he went directly to the neighboring palace the queen might have appeared already and it would not do to keep her waiting
test1741,hitherto the merchant had been induced it is true to advance large sums of money to the queen but the loyal devotion which he showed to her royal husband had rendered it impossible to give him even a
test1742,when harmer entered the residents of the grammae in the palace the guests had already assembled
test1743,the place by hermont's side which althea had chosen for herself would then be given up to arsenal
test1744,true an interesting conversation still had power to charm him but often during its continuance the full consciousness of his misfortune forced itself upon his mind for the majority of the subjects discussed by the artists came to
test1745,a stranger out of his own sphere he felt chilled among these closely united men and women to whom no tie bound him save the presence of the same host
test1746,cradets had really been invited in order to win him over to the queen's cause but charming fair harriet nicky had been commissioned by the conspirators to persuade him to sing arsenio's
test1747,his son had been the royal dame's first husband and she had despaired of him to marry luscinia the aged king of thrace
test1748,the king's sister the object of his love cried harmoniously credulously
test1749,we women are only as old as we look and the leeches entitling woman of this beauty of forty practice arts which give her the appearance of twenty five yet perhaps the king values her intellect
test1750,the three most trustworthy ones are here amethysts the leeches crescentia and the admirable procella
test1751,let us hope that you will make this three leafed clover the luck promising four leafed one
test1752,your uncle two has often with praise worthy generosity helped aurore in many an embarrassment
test1753,how long he kept you waiting from the first word concerning a work which justly transported the whole city with delight
test1754,when he did finally summon you he said things which must have warned you
test1755,that is going too far replied hermon
test1756,he winked at her and made a significant gesture as he spoke and then informed the blind artist how graciously arsenio had remembered him when she heard of the remedy by whose aid many a wonderful cure
test1757,the royal lady had inquired about tim and his sufferings with almost sisterly interest and althea eagerly confirmed the statement
test1758,her mom listened to the parent's silence
test1759,the rodenian was just beginning to praise arsenal also as a special friend and concierge of the sculptures art when crates hermann's fellow student asked the blind artist in behalf of his beautiful companion why
test1760,yet what mattered it even if these miserable people considered themselves deceived and pointed the finger of scorn at him
test1761,a woman who yearns for the regard of all men and makes love a toy easily lessens the demands she imposes upon individuals
test1762,only even though love has wholly disappeared she still claims consideration and althea did not wish to lose hermer's regard
test1763,how indifferent you look but i tell you her deep blue eyes flashed as she spoke that so long as you were still a genuine creating artist the case was different
test1764,though so loud a denial is written on your face i persist in my conviction and that no idle delusion and snags me i can prove
test1765,it was nay it could have been nothing else that very spider
test1766,not a sound if you value your lives
test1767,to offer resistance would have been madness for even herman perceived by the loud clanking of weapons around them the greatest superior power of the enemy and they were acting by the orders of the king to the
test1768,was he to be led to the executioners block
test1769,what pleasure had life lived to offer him the blind man who was already dead to his art
test1770,ought he not to greet his sudden end as a boon from the immortals?
test1771,did it not spare him a humiliation as great and painful as could be imagined
test1772,whatever might await him he desired no better fate
test1773,if he had passed into annihilation he hermon wished to follow him further and annihilation certainly meant redemption from pain and misery
test1774,but if he were destined to meet his mistress and his mother in the world beyond the grave had he not told them how sure he was that he was finding a joyful reception there from both
test1775,the power which delivered him over to death just at that moment was not nemesis no it was a kindly deity
test1776,yet it was no illusion that deceived him
test1777,again he heard the beloved voice and this time it addressed not only him but with the utmost haste the commander of the soldiers
test1778,sometimes with touching in treaty sometimes with imperial command she protested after giving him her name that this matter could be nothing but an unfortunate mistake
test1779,lastly with earnest warmth she besaid him before taking the prisoners away to permit her to speak to the commanding general philippus her father's guest who she was certain was in the palace
test1780,cried hariamon in grateful agitation but she would not listen to him and follow the soldier whom the captain detail to guide her into the palace
test1781,tomorrow you shall confess to me who treacherously directed you to this dangerous path
test1782,daphne again pleaded for the liberation of the prisoners but philippus' silence charged with a grave exclamation the order of the king
test1783,as soon as the captive artist was alone with the woman he loved he clasped her hand pouring forth in coherent words of the most ardent gratitude and when he felt her warmly returned the pressure he could
test1784,in spite of his deep mental distress he could have shouted aloud in his delight and gratitude
test1785,he might now have been permitted to bind forever to his life the woman who had just rescued him from the greatest danger but the confession he must make to his fellow artists in the pallor of the following
test1786,i love you and have loved you always.
test1787,davy exclaimed tenderly what more is needed
test1788,but haramon with wubbed head murmured to morrow i shall no longer be what i am now
test1789,then daphne raised her face to his asking so the demeter is the work of mercurialis
test1790,what a terrible ordeal again awaits you
test1791,and i fool blind also in mind could be vexed with you for it
test1792,bring this before your mind and everything else that you must accept with it if you consent when the time arrives to become mine conceal and paleto nothing
test1793,so akai intended to leave the city on one of his own ships that day
test1794,he himself on the way to expose himself to the malice and mockery of the whole city
test1795,his heart contracted painfully and his solicitude about his uncle's fate increased when philippus informed him that the conspirators had been arrested at the banquet and headed by aemilius the ruder
test1796,besides he knew that the object of his love would not part from him without granting him one last word
test1797,on the way his heart drooped almost to bursting
test1798,even daphne's image and what threatened her father and with her in him was receded far into the background
test1799,he was appearing before his companions only to give truth it's just do
test1800,the egyptians obeyed and his master crossed the wide space strewed with sand and approached the stage which had been erected for the festive performances even had his eyes retain the power of sight his
test1801,shouted his friend sartorius and joyful surprise in the midst of his painful walk haramon!
test1802,even while he believed himself to be the creator of the demeter he had been seriously troubled by the praise of so many critics because it had exposed him to the suspicion of having become faithless to his
test1803,honour to murtilla and his art but he trusted the noble feaststall assembly would pardon the unintentional deception and aid his prayer for recovery
test1804,afterward it was supposed that he was satisfied with the blood of oxen lamps and doves and that in exchange for or in account of these sacrifices this god gave rain sunshine and harvest
test1805,whether he was the creator of yourself and myself
test1806,whether any prayer was ever answered
test1807,why did he create the intellectually inferior
test1808,why did he create the defiled and helpless why did he create the criminal the idiotic the insane
test1809,are the failures under obligation to their creator
test1810,is he responsible for all the wars that have been waged for all the innocent blood that has been shed
test1811,is he responsible for the centuries of slavery for the backs that have been scarred with the lash for the babes that have been sold from the breasts of mothers for the families that have been separated and destroyed
test1812,is this god responsible for religious persecution for the inquisition for the thumb screw and rack and for all the instruments of torture
test1813,did this get allowed the cruel and vile to destroy the brave and virtuous
test1814,did he allow tyrants to shed the blood of patriots
test1815,can we conceive of a devil bays enough to prefer his enemies to his friends
test1816,how can we account for the wild beasts that devour human beings for the fanged serpents whose bite is death
test1817,how can we account for a world where life feeds on life
test1818,did infinite wisdom intentionally produce the microscopic beasts that feed upon the optics nurse think of blinding a man to satisfy the appetite of a microbe
test1819,fear builds the altar and offers the sacrifice
test1820,fear errects the cathedral and bows the head of man in worship
test1821,lits religious and fearful tremblingly repeated his passage though he slay me yet will i trust him
test1822,can we say that he cared for the children of men
test1823,can we say that is mercy endured forever
test1824,do we prove his goodness by showing that he has opened the earth and swallowed thousands of his helpless children or that with the volcanoes he has overthrown them with rivers of fire
test1825,was their goodness was their wisdom in this
test1826,or the superior race to signet cut that they are not inferior
test1827,most people linked to the supernatural
test1828,if they give up one god they imagine another
test1829,what is this power?
test1830,man advances and necessarily advances to experience
test1831,a man wishing to go to a certain place came towards where the road divides
test1832,he has tried that road and knows that it is the wrong road
test1833,a child shone by the beauty of the flame grasped it with his dimpled hand
test1834,the power that works for righteousness had taught the child a lesson
test1835,it is a result.
test1836,it is insisted by these theologians and by many of the so called philosophers that this moral sense this sense of duty of obligation was important and that conscience is an exotic
test1837,we live together in families tribes and nations
test1838,they are praised admired and respected
test1839,they are regarded as good that is to say as moral
test1840,the members who added to the misery of the family the tribe of the nation are considered bad men
test1841,the greatest of human beings had said conscience is born of love
test1842,as people advance the remote consequences are perceived
test1843,the imagination is cultivated.
test1844,a man puts himself in the place of another
test1845,the sense of duty becomes stronger more imperative
test1846,man judges himself
test1847,in all this there is nothing supernatural.
test1848,man has deceived himself
test1849,has christianity done good
test1850,when the church had control were men made better and happier
test1851,what has religion done for hungary or osteria
test1852,could these countries have been worse without religion?
test1853,could they have been worse had they had any other religion than christianity
test1854,what did christianity do for them
test1855,they hated pleasure
test1856,they muffled all the bells of gladness
test1857,the religion of the puritan was an unadulterated curse
test1858,the puritan believe the bible to be the word of god and this belief has always made those who held it cruel and wretched
test1859,let me refer to just one fact showing the influence of a belief in the bible on human beings
test1860,the queen received the bible kissed it and pledged herself to diligently read it
test1861,in other words it was just as feignedish just as infamous as the catholic spirit
test1862,has the bible made the people of georgia kind and merciful
test1863,religion has been tried and in all countries in all times has failed
test1864,religion has always been the enemy of science of investigation and thought
test1865,religion has never made men free
test1866,it has never made man moral tempered industrious and honest
test1867,are christians more temperate nearer virtuous nearer honest than savages
test1868,can we cure disease by supplication
test1869,can we receive virtue or honor as arms
test1870,religion rests on the idea that nature has a master and that this master will listen to prayer that this master punishes and rewards that he loves praise and fattery and hates the brave and free
test1871,we must have crowned the stones
test1872,the structure must have a basin
test1873,if we build we must begin at the bottom
test1874,i have a theory and i have four cornerstones
test1875,the first stone is that matter substance cannot be destroyed cannot be annihilated
test1876,if these cornerstones are facts it follows as a necessity that matter and force are from and to eternity that they can neither be increased nor diminished
test1877,it follows that nothing has been or can be created that there never has been or can be a creator
test1878,it followed that there could not have been any intelligence any design back of matter and force
test1879,i say what i think
test1880,every event has parents.
test1881,that which has not happened could not
test1882,in the infinite chain wrists and can be no broken no missing link
test1883,we now know that our first parents were not foreigners
test1884,we now know if we know anything that the universe is natural and that men and women have naturally produced
test1885,we know the parts that life has traveled
test1886,we know the footsteps of advance they have been traced
test1887,for thousands of years men and women have been trying to reform the world
test1888,why have the reforms failed
test1889,they depend on the lord on luck and charity
test1890,they live by fraud and violence and bequith their vices to their children
test1891,failure seems to be the trademark of nature why
test1892,nature produced without purpose sustains without intention and destroys without thought
test1893,must the world forever remain a victim of ignorant passion
test1894,why should men and women have children that they cannot take care of children that are a burden and curses why
test1895,pasion is and always has been death
test1896,law can punish but it can neither reform criminals nor prevent crime
test1897,this cannot be done by talk or example
test1898,this is the solution of the whole question
test1899,this freezes women
test1900,poverty and crime will be childish
test1901,it is far better to be free to leave the faults and barricades of fear to stand erect and face the future with a smile
test1902,there done for said the schoolmaster in a low key to the shwet out with your vitriol and mind your eye
test1903,the two monsters took off their shoes and moved stealthily along keeping in the shadows of the houses
test1904,by means of this stratagem they followed so closely that although within a few steps of sara and tom they did not hear them
test1905,sarah and her brother having again passed by the tuppenny frank arrived close to the dilapidated house which was partly in ruins and its open cellars formed a kind of gulf along which the
test1906,in an instant the schoolmaster with a leap resembling strength and agility the spring of a tiger seized with one hand by the throat and exclaimed your money or i will fling you into this hole
test1907,"no! said the old brook, tremblingly no not one ring, what a shame!"
test1908,tom seitan did not lose his presence of mind during this scene rapidly and unexpectedly as it had occurred
test1909,oo ah to lay a trap to catches replied the thief
test1910,then addressing thomas seaton you know the plane of st. deny
test1911,did you see in the cabaret we had just left for i know you again the man whom the charioteer came to seek
test1912,cried the schoolmaster a thousand francs and i'll kill him!
test1913,witch i do not see his life replied sarah to the schoolmaster
test1914,let us go and meet him
test1915,all by it will it pay for looking after?
test1916,well my wife shall be there said the schoolmaster you will tell her what you want and i shall see
test1917,"in the plain of sainte-denis,"
test1918,between saint walter and the road of revolt at the end of the road agreed
test1919,"he had forgotten the address of the self-styled painter,"
test1920,the fehuka started
test1921,france who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed
test1922,my very good friend an excellent neighbour replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exertions
test1923,my father the conde de mosse although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of france and at madrid and i anxiously place the best services of myself and all to whom my life
test1924,i can scarcely credit it.
test1925,then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated
test1926,shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour in quiet the count only let me warn you that i am preverbal for my punctilio exactitude in keeping my engagements day for
test1927,so be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards the calendar suspended near the chimney piece he said to-day is the twenty first of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly half
test1928,i reside in my father's house but occupy a pavilion at the farthest side of the courtyard and tiles are separated from the main building
test1929,now then said the count returning his tablets to his pocket make yourself perfectly easy the hand of your time piece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself
test1930,that depends when do you leave?
test1931,for france no for venice i shall remain in italy for another year or two
test1932,then we shall not meet in paris.
test1933,i fear i shall not have that honour.
test1934,"well since we must part, said the count, holding out a hand to each of the young men allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey,"
test1935,what is the matter asked albert of france when they had returned to their own apartments you seem more than commonly thoughtful
test1936,i will confess to you albert replied france the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions
test1937,did you ever meet him previously to coming hither?
test1938,upon my honour then listen to me
test1939,he dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the broil of the thousand and one nights he recounted with
test1940,then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the coliseum between the count and vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit pappino an engagement which as
test1941,but said france the cauchon bandits that were among the crew of his vessel
test1942,"why, really the thing seems to me simple enough."
test1943,talking of countries replied france of what countries the count what is his native tongue when does he derive his immense fortune and what are those events of his early life a life as marvelous as unknown that have tint
test1944,certainly these are questions that stand in your place i should like to have answered
test1945,my dear france replied albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the count's assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend albert the most sincere is in danger helped me
test1946,what are his means of existence what is his birthplace of what countries he is native of
test1947,i confess he asked me none no he merely came and freed me from the hands of senior vampir where i can assure you in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and un concern i did not
test1948,and this time it must be confessed that contrary to richard the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on albert's side
test1949,well said frances with a sigh do as you please my dear vizier for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation
test1950,"and now, my dear frances, let us talk of something else."
test1951,then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination albert moseley could follow up his researches by means of a small gauge similar to that closely to the concierge's store and which merits
test1952,shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate
test1953,at quarter to ten a valiant entered he composed with a little room name john and who only spoke english all albert's establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great
test1954,wait then during the day tell rosa that when i leave the opera i will sup with her as she wishes
test1955,"very well at half past ten,"
test1956,is the counters up yet?
test1957,the valley left the room.
test1958,"good morning, rucius, good morning said albert your punctuality really alarms me."
test1959,"you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was half past,"
test1960,"no, my dear fellow, do not confound our plans."
test1961,"yes, he has not much to complain of bourges is the capital of charles the seventh."
test1962,it is for that reason you see me so early.
test1963,"i returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep but my head ached and i got up to have a ride for an hour,"
test1964,pests! i will do nothing of the kind the moment they come from government you would find them acquirable.
test1965,"besides that, that does not concern the home but the financial department,"
test1966,about what about the papers?
test1967,"in the entire political world of which you are one of the leaders,"
test1968,they say that it is quite fair and that sowing so much red you ought to reap a little blue
test1969,"come, come, that is not bad, said lucia."
test1970,"with your talents you would make your fortune in three or four years,"
test1971,the gentleman had not even needed to sit down to become interested apparently he had taken up the volume from a table as soon as he came in and standing there after a single glance round the apartment had lost
test1972,that has an unflattering sound for me said the young man
test1973,she is willing to risk that
test1974,just as i am the visitor presenting himself with a rather a workaday aspect
test1975,he was tall and lean and dressed through out in black his shirt colour was low and wide and the triangle of linen a little crumpled exhibited by the opening of his waist coat was adorned by a
test1976,in spite of this decoration the young man looked poor as poor a young man could have who had such a fine head and such magnificent eyes
test1977,those of basil's ransom were dark deep and glowing his head had a character of elevation which fairly added to his stature it was a head to be seen above the level of the crowd on some judicial bench
test1978,these things the eyes especially with their smearing fire might have indicated that he was to be a great american statesman or on the other hand they might simply have proved that he came from carolina or
test1979,and yet the reader who likes a complete image who desires to read with the senses as with the reason is envious not to forget that he prolonged his consonance and swallowed his vowels that he was guilty
test1980,and he took up his hat vagily a soft black hat with a low crown and an immense straight brim
test1981,well so it is they are all witches and wizards mediums and spirit rappers and roaring radicals
test1982,if you are going to dine with her you had better know it oh murder
test1983,he looked at mrs. luna with intelligent incredulity
test1984,she was attractive and impertinent especially the latter
test1985,have you been in europe?
test1986,no i haven't been anywhere.
test1987,she hates it she would like to abolish it
test1988,this last remark he made at ventura for he had naturally not devoted his supposition whatever to mrs. luna
test1989,are you very ambitious you look as if you wear
test1990,and mrs. luna added that now she was back she didn't know what she should do
test1991,one didn't even know what one had come back for
test1992,besides oliver didn't want her in boston and didn't go through the form of saying so
test1993,that was one comfort with olive she never went through any forms
test1994,she stood there looking consciously and rather seriously and missed a ransom a smile of exceeding faintness played about her lips it was just perceptible enough to light up the native gravity of her face
test1995,her voice was low and agreeable a cultivated voice and she extended a slender white hand to her visitor her remarked with some solemnity he felt a certain gilt of participation in missus luna's
test1996,he observed that miss chancellor's hand was at once called in and limp she merely placed it in her's without exerting the smallest pressure
test1997,i shall be back very late we're going to a theatre party that's why we dine so early
test1998,miss louisa's familiarity extended even to her sister she remarked to miss chancellor that she looked as if she had gotten up for a sea voyage
test1999,paul ransom announced this fact to himself as if he had made a great discovery but in reality he had never been so beauchain as at that moment
test2000,the woman he had hitherto known had been mainly of his own soft climb and it was not often they exhibited the tendency he detected and curiously depreciated in missus luna's sister
test2001,ransom was pleased with the vision of that remedy it must be repeated that he was very provincial
test2002,he was sorry for her but he saw in a flash that no one could help her that was what made her tragic
test2003,she could not defend herself against a rich admiration a kind of tenderness of envy of any one who had been so happy as to have that opportunity
test2004,his family was ruined they had lost their slaves their property their friends and relations their home had tasted of all the cruelty of defeat
test2005,the state of mississippi seemed to him the state of despair so he surrendered the remnants of his patrimony to his mother and sisters and at nearly thirty years of age alighted for the first time
test2006,it was in the female line as baileys ransom had written in answering her letter with a good deal of form and flourish he spoke as if they had been royal houses
test2007,if it had been possible to send missus ransom money or even clothes she would have liked that but she had no means of assuring how such an offering would be taken
test2008,oliver had a fear of everything but her greatest fear was of being afraid
test2009,she had erected it into a sort of rule of conduct that whenever she saw a risk she was to take it and she had frequent humiliations at finding herself safe after all
test2010,she was perfectly safe after writing to basil and ransom and indeed it was difficult to see what he had done to her except thank her he was only exceptionally superfluous for her letter and assure her that
test2011,he was too simple too mississippiian for that she was almost disappointed
test2012,of all things in the world contention was most sweet to her the why it is hard to imagine for who always cast her tears headaches a day or two in bed a quiet emotion and it was very possible
test2013,miss chancellor himself thought so much on the vital subject would not she make a few remarks and give them some of her experiences?
test2014,how did the ladies in beacon street feel about the ballot?
test2015,"perhaps she could speak for them, more than for some others."
test2016,"with her immense sympathy for reform she found herself so often wishing that reformers were a little different,"
test2017,oliver had hated to hear that fine avenue talked about as if it was such a remarkable place and to live there were a proof of royal glory.
test2018,all sorts of inferior people dwelt there and so brilliant a woman as mrs. farrander who lived at ruxbury ought not to mix things up.
test2019,she knew her place in the boston hierarchy and it was not what missus farner supposed that there was a want of perspective in talking to her as if she had been a representative of the arist
test2020,"she wished to wake in another field she had long been concerned with the romance of the people,"
test2021,this might seem one of the most accessible of pleasures but in point of fact she had not found it at all
test2022,charlie was a young man in a white overcoat and a paper collar it was for him in the last analysis that they cared much the most
test2023,oliver chancellor wondered how missus stinder would treat their branch of the question.
test2024,if it be necessary we are prepared to take certain steps to conciliate the shrinking.
test2025,our movement is for all it is also the most delicate ladies.
test2026,"raised the standard among them and bring me your thousand names,"
test2027,a look after the details as well as the book kents added in a tone as explanatory as could be expected of such a woman and with a smile of which the sweetness was thrilling to her listener
test2028,said olde chancellor with a face which seemed to plea for a remission of his responsibility.
test2029,i want to be near them to help them.
test2030,it was one thing to choose for herself but now the great representative of the enfranchisement of their sex from every form of bondage had chosen for her
test2031,the unhappiness of women
test2032,they were her sisters they were her own and the day of their delivery had dawned.
test2033,this was the only sacred cause this was the great the dust revolution it was triumph it was sweep everything before it it must exact from the other the brutal blood stained ravaging race the last particle of ex
test2034,"there would be names of women weak, insulted, persecuted but devoted in every parts of their being to the cause and asking no better fate than to die for it."
test2035,it was not clear to this interesting girl in what manner such a sacrifice at this last would be required of her that she sold a matter through a kind of sunwise mist of emotion which made danger as
test2036,when miss bird's eye approached it transfigured her familiar her comical shape and made the poor little humanitarian hack seem already a martyr
test2037,oliver chancellor looked at her with love remembered that she had never in her long and rewarded weary life had a thought on an impulse for herself.
test2038,she had been consumed by the passion of sympathy it had crumbled her into as many creases as an old glazed distended glove
test2039,"but excuse me, didn't you figure on doing some detecting and giving up fishing?"
test2040,"and shag, with the freedom of an old servant stood looking at his master as if not quite understanding the new twist the affairs had taken."
test2041,i'm going off fishing. i may not catch anything and may not want to after i get there.
test2042,"get ready, shag. yes, sir, colonel."
test2043,and having put himself in a fair way as he hoped to solve some of the problems connected with the darsey case colonel ashley went down to police headquarters to learn more facts in the connection with
test2044,"pincus and donovan haven't they, carol? yup."
test2045,carol was too much engaged in watching the smoke curl lazily upward from his cigar just then to say more.
test2046,"are you going to work on that case, colonel?"
test2047,"but he hadn't any more to do with it, than the cat."
test2048,"perhaps not, admitted colonel ashley."
test2049,we've got our man and that's all we want.
test2050,"you're on the darcy case they tell me in a way, yes."
test2051,"i'm working in the interest of the young men,"
test2052,it's just one of them coincidences like.
test2053,busted his head in with a heavy candlestick one of a pair.
test2054,"gad, explaining the colonel,"
test2055,the very pair i was going to buy.
test2056,"look here, colonel, do you know anything about this?"
test2057,and the detectives' professional instincts got the upper hand of his friendship not the least in the world not as much as you do was the cool answer.
test2058,i happened to see those candlesticks in the window of single-felt shop the other day and i may have had my mind to buy them when i had a chance.
test2059,now i'm afraid i won't but how did it happen?
test2060,but i don't know whether that's his first or his last name anyhow he had a partner named sherry lee.
test2061,"anyhow, he and fit didn't get along very well, it seems."
test2062,neighbors often heard them cracking a lot and this afternoon they went at it again and hot and heavy.
test2063,to dark a man went in to buy a lamp.
test2064,he found the place without a light in it stumbled over something on the floor and there was alice's body with the head busted in and this heavy candlestick near it
test2065,"sure, held so tight we could hardly get it out."
test2066,maybe the fight was about who owned the watch for the dagos talked in their foreign lingo and none of the neighbors could tell what they were saying i see.
test2067,"and the watch, have you it yes, it's here."
test2068,"that's the watch announced the headquarters detective, reaching in for it going in, see."
test2069,"you're not as screamin' all that, are you? just because it was in a dead man's hands and a woman's?"
test2070,and donaldson's voice was plainly skeptical.
test2071,"yes, it may have some rough edges on it."
test2072,and i've read enough about germ's to know the danger i'd advise you to be careful.
test2073,if you don't mind i should like to examine this bit.
test2074,"before the big wind in ireland suggested thong with the nod of isis' companion slightly, they'll have the colonel,"
test2075,"that's right, agreed the colonel as he continued to move his magnifying glass over the surface of the still-ticking watch."
test2076,and a close observer might have observed that he did not touch his bare fingers to the timepiece but poked it about and touched it here and there with the end of a lead pencil.
test2077,and donovan take a friend's advice and don't be too free with that watch too free with it.
test2078,asked the surprise detective yes.
test2079,"don't scratch yourself on it, whatever you do why not?"
test2080,"simply because this watch,"
test2081,someone out here to see you.
test2082,"all right, be there in a second."
test2083,shing-fu was the painting answer.
test2084,i want to talk over darwin's case with you the chancellor had said and the two had talked had thought had talked again and now we were silent for a time.
test2085,what are the chances of getting him off legally if we go at it from a negative standpoint? asked the colonel.
test2086,"rather a hypothetical question, colonel but i should say it might be a fifty-fifty proposition."
test2087,at best he would get off with a scotch verdict of not proven but he doesn't want that nor do i
test2088,and you i don't want it either.
test2089,but i want to know just where we stand now i know.
test2090,but i need to do a little more smoking out first now i wanted to think.
test2091,"if you'll excuse me, i'll pretend i'm fishing and i may catch something."
test2092,in fact i have a feeling that i shall land my fish.
test2093,"i'd recommend him to you instead of blackstone thanks, slapped kenneth."
test2094,what is it perhaps i can help you?
test2095,"the old adage of two heads, you know?"
test2096,"yes, it still holds good."
test2097,no allomony replied the colonel puzzled yes just that.
test2098,and there's no reason you shouldn't know.
test2099,cheeked the colonel as he skillfully played the luckless trout now struggling to get loose from the hook.
test2100,and when the fish was landed panting on the grass and shach had been roused from his lumber to slip the now limp fish into the creel colonel ashley gave a sigh of relief
test2101,"the reason she asked no allomancy inquired kenneth,"
test2102,"no, i wasn't thinking of that."
test2103,"however, don't think i'm not interested in your case i've finished enough for to-day"
test2104,"well, i don't know that you can."
test2105,"it isn't generally known when the lawyer that the hotel keeper's wife has left him,"
test2106,it was one of what might be called refined cruelty on her husband's part degenerating gradually into that of a baser sort
test2107,"you don't mean that large struck her that there was physical abuse, do you? asked the colonel that's what he did."
test2108,the colonel did not disclose the fact that it was no news to him.
test2109,arnold grafft's statement was being unexpectedly confirmed.
test2110,he remembered that cynthia and grath had once been in love with each other.
test2111,she said he had struck her more than once and she could stand it no longer.
test2112,because larghe made no defence.
test2113,larch by refusing to appear practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation.
test2114,so i had to let her have her way and we did not ask the court for money though i had no such squeamish feelings when it came to my counsel fee
test2115,no but he will or i'll sue him and get judgment oh he'll pay all right.
test2116,and it takes all sorts of persons to make it up.
test2117,"still i would like to know,"
test2118,the murderer of mrs. darcy had some time ago been shifted off the front page though it would get back there when the young jeweller was tried.
test2119,"it had a double reputation, so to speak."
test2120,grave and even reverend the conveniences assembled in its ballroom and politicians of the upper if not better class were frequently seen in its dining room or cafe
test2121,"larch, hisself, was a peculiar character,"
test2122,"in a smaller place he would have been called a salon-keeper,"
test2123,"and it was this man rich, it was said handsome certainly that christina rachet had married,"
test2124,"to this was the answer, whispered money."
test2125,"and, in a way, it was true."
test2126,she also saw an opportunity of paying old debts and reaping some rewards
test2127,"after the marriage which was a brilliant and gay man, if not happy, the large hotel, it could hardly be called a home became the scene of many festal occasions"
test2128,then it was said of large that soon after the echoes of the wedding chimes died away he had begun to treat his wife with refined cruelty that hidden away from the public underneath his habitual manner there was
test2129,but it was noticed that the older and more conservative families were less often represented and when they were it was by some of the younger members whose reputations were already smirched or who had not yet
test2130,it wouldn't do you know after that story came out for me and the vice-chancellor who sat in the case as well as other judges and members of the bar to be seen there kenneth explained
test2131,"meanwhile, colonel ashley was a very busy man and to no one did he tell very much about his activities he saw darcy frequently at the jail and to that young man's pleas that something"
test2132,don't worry it will come out all right.
test2133,i'm going to rectify them but it will take time.
test2134,"it's hard for miss mason, too, although she's bearing up like a major."
test2135,"so king got bale, who put it up,"
test2136,it was high marsh
test2137,they took harry away a while ago.
test2138,but his are pretty uncertain to be in just the same.
test2139,only that i darcy hesitated and grew red.
test2140,"good evening, colonel, he called genially, will you join me in a welsh rabbit?"
test2141,thank you. no.
test2142,i'm afraid my digestion isn't quite up to that as i've had to cut out my fishing of late.
test2143,"now as to certain matters in the store on the morning of the murder,"
test2144,the stopped clocks for instance have you any theory?
test2145,there were three of them the center figure being that of harry king and he was very much intoxicated
test2146,"that is not always, but sometimes it happened to be so now."
test2147,"i beg your pardon, he said in the cultured tones he knew so well how to use yet of which he made so little use of late."
test2148,i said where have you been? remarked the other we've missed you.
test2149,i said i was golfing he went on exceedingly distinctly though with an effort.
test2150,"why polonius, some one asked?"
test2151,because dear friend replied king softly he somewhat resembles a certain person here who talks too much but who is not so wise as he thinks
test2152,"there was a rattle of coins on the mahogany bars, king sought to disentangle a single bill from the wattled currency in his pocket."
test2153,it's it's an odd coin an old roman one that mrs. darcy had in her private collection kept in the jewelry store safe was the whispered answer
test2154,i went over them the day before and noticed some were missing though i saw them all when i paid a visit to her just a short time before she was killed.
test2155,"that was hers, went on the jaur,"
test2156,"now harry king has exclaimed, colonel ashley,"
test2157,even the sun came out pale and watery at noon
test2158,the coals and drudgism of the rainy months vanished
test2159,asked worker last sunday you did it when the youngers
test2160,"well, didn't they shoot us? one man exhibited his arm in a sling."
test2161, haven't i got something to remember them by?
test2162,who are you to destroy the legal government who is leonard a german
test2163,who are you a counter-revolutionist a provocateur they be beloved at him
test2164,you call yourselves the people of russia but you are not the people of russia
test2165,the peasants are the people of russia wait until the peasants.
test2166,we know what the peasants will say aren't they working men like ourselves?
test2167,this man has specially welcomed the call to a congress of persons
test2168,this last were the young generation who had been serving in the army
test2169,"whereupon the old executive committee left the hall,"
test2170,down with him they shrieked
test2171,fearful dalmatians cries down with the palisade key
test2172,upon my return i visited smalley no such accusation was made against me there after a brief conversation i left and that's all let any one present make such an accusation
test2173,meanwhile the question of the status of the executive committee was agitating all minds
test2174,by declaring the assembly extraordinary conference it had been planned to block the re election of the executive committee
test2175,but this worked both ways the social revolutionary decided that if the congress had no power over the executive committee then the executive committee had no power over the congress

test2179,the first stage was the crushing of autocracy and the crushing of the power of the industrial capitalists and the landowners whose interests are closely related
test2180,the tummies and stoves were dropped
test2181,he knew that an agreement with the peshawiki was being discussed but he did not know that it had been concluded
test2182,he spoke to the rum convention
test2183,"the villages will save us in the end,"
test2184,but the present movement is international and that is why it is invincible
test2185,the wheel of millions of workers is now concentrated in the hall
test2186,a new humanity will be born of this war
test2187,i greet you with the christening of a new russian life and freedom.
test2188,then i took up a great stone from among the trees and coming up to him smote him thereon with the head with all my might and crushed in his skull as he lay dead drunk
test2189,behold a ship was making for the island through the dashing sea and clashing waves
test2190,hearing this i was so troubled remembering what i had before suffered from the ape kind
test2191,upon this he bought me a cotton bag and given it to him said take this bag and fill it with pebbles from the beach and go forth with a company of the townsfolk to whom i
test2192,do as they do and be like thou shalt gain what may further thy return voyage to thy native land
test2193,then he carried me to the beach where i filled my bag with pebbles large and small and presently we saw a company of folk issue from the town each bearing a bag like mine filled with pe
test2194,to these he committed me commending me to their care and saying this man is a stranger so take him with you and teach him how to gather that he may get his daily bread and you will earn
test2195,now sleeping under these trees were many apes which when they saw us rose and fled from us and swam up among the branches whereupon my companions began to pelt them with what they had in
test2196,we weighed anchor and shirazard perceived to the dawn of the day and ceased to say in her permitted say
test2197,when it was the five hundred and fifty ninth night
test2198,and ceased not sailing till we arrived safely at vasar
test2199,there i abode a little and then went on to bagdad where i entered my quarter and found my house and for gathered with my family and saluted my friends who gave me joy of my safe
test2200,after which i shall return to my old merry way of life and forgot all i had suffered in the great profit and gain i had made
test2201,next morning as soon as it was light he prayed the dawn prayer and after blessing hamman the cream of all creatures he took himself to the house of sinbad the sea-man and wished him a good
test2202,here i found a great ship ready for sea and full of merchants and notables who had with them goods of price so i embarked my bales therein
test2203,happily amongst you is one righteous whose prayers the lord will accept
test2204,presently the ship struck the mountain and broke up and all and everything on board of her was plunged into the sea
test2205,but it burneth in their bellies so they cast it up again and it congealeth on the surface of the water whereby its colour and quantities are changed and at last the waves cast it
test2206,each that died we washed and shrunk in some of the clothes and linen cast ashore by the tides and after little the rest of my fellows perished one by one till i had buried the
test2207,but there is majesty and there is no might save ala the glorious the great
test2208,when it was the five hundred and sixty first night
test2209,then signing for myself i set to work collecting a number of pieces of chinese and coriander aloes wood and i bound them together with ropes from the wreck then i chose out from the broken up
test2210,land after land shall thine seek confined but no other life on thy wish shall wait fret not thy soul in thy thoughts a thoughts a night all woes shall end or sooner or late
test2211,i rode my conveyance into the place which was intensely dark and the current carried me raft with it down the underground channel
test2212,and i threw myself down upon my face on the raft by reason of the narrowness of the channel whilst the streams ceased not to carry me along knowing not night from day for the excess of the glo
test2213,when i awaked at last i found myself in the light of heaven and opening my eyes i saw myself in a broad stream and the raft moored to an island in the midst of a number of
test2214,but i was delighted at my escape from the river
test2215,when they saw i understood them not and made them no answer one of them came forward and said to me in arabic peace be with ye my brother
test2216,oh my brother answered he we are husbandmen and tillers of the soil who came out to water our fields and plantations and finding thee asleep on this raft laid hold of it and made it fast
test2217,i answered for allah's sake o my lord ere i speak give me somewhat to eat for i am starving and after ask me what thou wilt
test2218,when it was the five hundred and sixty second night
test2219,she said it had reached me auspicious king that sinbad the sailor continued when i landed and found myself amongst the indian and abbasinians and had taken some rest they consulted among themselves and said
test2220,so i consoled with the chief of the islanders and they paid me the utmost respect
test2221,so i rose without stay or delay and kissed the king's hand and accented him with my longing to set out with the merchants for that i pined after my people and mine own land
test2222,quoth he thou art thine own master yet if it be thy will to abide with us on her head and nails be it for thy gladness with thy company
test2223,by allah are my lord answered i thou hast indeed overwhelmed me with thy favours and well doings but i weary for a sight of my friends and family and native country
test2224,then i took leave of him and of all my intimates and acquaintances in the island and embarked with the merchant saphir
test2225,he asked me when they came and i said to him by allah a commander of the faithful i know not the name of the city nor the way thereto
test2226,for state presences a throne is set for him upon a huge elephant eleven quiberts high and upon this he sitteth having his great lords and officers and guests standing in two ranks on his
test2227,his letter hath shown me this and as for the majesty of his dominion that hath told us what there now hath been witnessed
test2228,presently my friends came to me and i distributed presence among my family and gave arms and largesse after which i yielded myself to joints and enjoyment mirth and merry making and forgot all that i had
test2229,such then our brothers is the history of what befell me in my sixth voyage and to morrow inshallah
test2230,i will tell you the story of my seventh and last voyage which is still more wondrous and marvelous than that of the first six
test2231,when it was the five hundred and sixty third night
test2232,she said it hath reached me oh auspicious king that when sinbad the sailor had related the history of what befell him in his sixth voyage and all the company had dispersed sinbad the landsman
test2233,the seventh voyage of sinbad the sailor
test2234,know o company that after my return from my sixth voyage which brought me abundant profit i resumed my former life and all possible joints and enjoyment and mirth and making merry day and night and i tarried
test2235,so having made up my mind i packed up in bales a quantity of precious stuffs suitable for sea trade and repaired with them from bagdad city to basra town where i found a ship ready
test2236,but the captain arose and tightened in his girdle tucked up his skirts and after taking refuge with allah from satan the stoned climbed to the masthead when he looked out right and left
test2237,this he sat in a saucer wetted with a little water and after waiting a short time smelted and tasted it and then he took out of the chest a booklet wherein he read a while
test2238,a second fish rated its appearance and which we had seen nought more monstrous
test2239,when suddenly a violent squall of wind arose and smote the ship which rose out of the water and settled upon a great reef the haunt of sea monsters where it broke up and fell asunder into
test2240,unfortunately there could be no doubt or misconception as the platter's guilt
test2241,he had not only plighted guilty but had expressed his intention of repeating his escapade in other directions as soon as circumstances permitted throughout the trial he was busy examining a small model of the free trade hall
test2242,the jury could not possibly find that the prisoner had not deliberately and intentionally blown up the albert hall the albert hall hall the question was could they find any insinuating circumstances which would permit of
test2243,of course any sentence which the law might feel compelled to inflict would be followed by an immediate pardon but it was highly desirable from the government's point of view that the necessity for such an exercise of clem
test2244,i had long pardon on the eve of a by election with threats of a heavy voting deficiency if it were withheld or delayed would not necessarily be a surrender but it would look like one
test2245,hence the anxiety in the crowded court and in the little groups gathered round the tape machines in white hall and donning street and other affected centres
test2246,the jury returned from considering their verdict there was a flutter an excited murmur a death-like hush
test2247,the foreman delivered his message
test2248,the jury find a prisoner guilty of blowing up the elbert hall
test2249,the jury wished to add a writer drawing attention to the fact that a bye election is spending in the parliamentary division of nemesis on hand
test2250,and may the lord have mercy on the pole a junior counsel exclaimed irreverently
test2251,fifteen hundred said the prime minister with a shudder it's too horrible to think of
test2252,our majority last time was only a thousand and seven.
test2253,seven thirty amended the prime minister we must avoid any appearance of precipitancy
test2254,not later than seven thirty den said the chief organizer i have promised the agent down there that he shall be able to display posters announcing platterbath is out before the pole opens
test2255,he said it was our only chance of getting a telegram redrapes in to-night
test2256,despite the earlyness of the hour a small crowd had gathered in the street outside and the horrible menacing twirl of the refrain of the fifteen hundred voting men came in a steady monotone chant
test2257,"he exclaimed, won't go?"
test2258,he says he has never left prison without a breastband to play him out and he is not going to go without one now
test2259,said the prime minister we can hardly be supposed to supply a released prisoner with a brass band how on earth could we defend it on the estimates
test2260,any way he won't go unless he has a pen
test2261,paul opens in five minutes.
test2262,splatter buff out yet
test2263,in heaven's name why?
test2264,the chief organizer rang off
test2265,this is not a moment for standing indignation he observed bluntly musicians must be supplied at once
test2266,can't you get a strike permit as the organizer?
test2267,i'll try said the home secretary and went to the telephone
test2268,eight o'clock struck the crowd outside chanting with an increasing volume of sound will vote the other way
test2269,a telegraph was brought in
test2270,it was from the central committee rooms at nemesis
test2271,without a band he would not go and they had no band
test2272,a quarter past ten half past
test2273,have you any band instruments of an easy nature to play?
test2274,demanded the chief organizer of the prison governor drums symbols those sort of things
test2275,though warders have a private band of their own said the governor but of course i couldn't allow them the men themselves
test2276,lend us the instruments said chief organizer
test2277,the popular song of the moment replied the agitator after a moment's reflection
test2278,it was a tune they had all heard hundreds of times so there was no difficulty in turning out a passable imitation of it to the improvised trains of i don't want to do it the prisoners tro
test2279,the word of the song had reference it was understood to the incarcerating government and not to the destroyer of the albert hall
test2280,this seat was lost after all by a narrow maturity
test2281,the local trade unionists took offense at the fact of cabinet ministers having personally acted as strikebreakers and even the release of platterbaff failed to pacify them
test2282,with that notorious failing of his he was not the sort of person one wanted in one's house
test2283,well the failing still exists doesn't it said the husband or do you suppose a reform of characters is entailed along with the estate
test2284,besides sensational part his being rich will make a difference in the way people will look at his failing
test2285,when a man is absolutely wealthy not merely well to do all suspicion of sorted motive naturally disappears the thing becomes merely a tiresome melody
test2286,wilfred pigeon coat had suddenly become air to his uncle sir wilfred pigeon coat on the death of his cousin major wilfred pigeon coat who had succumbed to the after effects of apollo accident
test2287,a wilfred pigeon coat had covered himself with honours in the course of malborough's campaigns and the name louis wilfred had been a pious weakness in the family ever since the new heir to
test2288,and the reputation was an unpleasant one.
test2289,from his late school days onward he had been possessed by an acute and obstinate form of kleptomania he had the acquisitive instinct of the collector without any of the collectors' discrimination
test2290,the search usually produces a large and varied yield this is funny said peter pigeon to his wife some half a hour after their conversation here is a telegraph from wilfred saying he is passing through here in
test2291,signed wilfred pigeon coat.
test2292,i suppose he's bringing us a present for the silver wedding good gracious
test2293,the talk flitted nervously and hurriedly from one personal topic to another
test2294,in the drawing room after dinner their nervousness and awkwardness increased
test2295,oh we haven't shown you the silver wedding presents said missus peter suddenly as those struck by a brilliant idea for entertaining the guest here they all are
test2296,such nice useful gifts a few duplicates of course
test2297,seven cream jugs put in peter
test2298,we feel that we must live on cream for the rest of our lives.
test2299,of course some of them can be changed
test2300,i put it down by the claque jar said wilfred busy with another object
test2301,vigilance was not completely crowned with a sense of victory
test2302,after they had said good night to their visitor missus peter expressed her conviction that he had taken something
test2303,how on earth are we to know said peter the mean pig hasn't brought us a present and i'm hung if he shall carry one off
test2304,is the only thing to do.
test2305,wilfred was late in coming down to breakfast and his manner showed plainly that something was amiss
test2306,it's an unpleasant thing to have to say he blurted out presently but i'm afraid you must have a thief among your servants something's been taken out of my portmanteau
test2307,it was a little present from my mother and myself for your silver wedding
test2308,i should have given it to you last night after dinner only it happened to be a green jug and you seemed annoyed at having so many duplicates so i felt rather awkward about giving you another
test2309,the snatcher had been an orphan this many years
test2310,lady ernestine pigeon-coat his mother moved in circles which were entirely beyond their compass or ambitions and the son would probably one day be an ambassador
test2311,husband and wife looked blankly and desperately at one another
test2312,it was mrs peter who arrived first at an inspiration how dreadful to think there were thieves in the house we kept a drawing room locked up at night of course but anything might be carried off while we
test2313,she rose and went out hurriedly as though to assure herself that the drawing room was not being stripped of its silverware and returned a moment later bearing a cream jug in her hands
test2314,the pigeon coots had turned palether than ever mrs peter had a final inspiration
test2315,peter dashed out of the room with glad relief he had lived so long during the last few minutes that a golden wedding seemed within measurable distance
test2316,mrs. peter turned to her guest with confidential coinage
test2317,peter's little weakness it transpires in the family good lord
test2318,do you mean to say he's an ectoplasmic like cousin snatcher?
test2319,brave little woman said beret with a gasp of relief i could never have done it
test2320,i'm from the cutter lying off the coast
test2321,don't cry he said i was obliged to come
test2322,and and you have not found out anything came in frightful tones
test2323,i wish you would believe me that i am in great trouble about it as you are
test2324,that my father sir rizmond graham had smuggled goods here
test2325,he could not help it he hates the smugglers you shall not tell
test2326,pray pray say you not archer is silent
test2327,then as archer stood in the dark literally agash with astonishment he heard the faint rustling once more and again all was silent
test2328,he laughed but it was a curious kind of laugh full of vexation injured amour propre as the prince called aloud of our own dignity of which arachne's ray stroke in the full flush of
test2329,and all comes of dressing up in this stupid way like a rough fisher lad
test2330,cold water came on this idea directly as he recalled the fact that the darkness was intense and celia could not have seen him
test2331,i'll soon show them that i am not going to be played with
test2332,for it suddenly occurred to him that he was not only a prisoner but a prisoner in the power of a very reckless set of people who would stop it nothing
test2333,no he thought to himself i don't believe they would kill me but they would knock me about
test2334,the kick he had received was a foretaste of what he might expect and after a little consideration he came to the conclusion that his duty was to escape and get back to the cutter as quickly as
test2335,to do this he must scheme lie hid till morning then make for the nearest point and signal for help unless a boat crew were already searching for him how to escape
test2336,the window was barred but he went to it and tried the bars one by one to find them all solidly fitted into the stone sill
test2337,next moment as he felt his way about his hand touched an old marble mantlepiece fireplace chimney
test2338,yes if otherwise failed he could escape up the chimney
test2339,no that was too bad he could not do that
test2340,sympathy and pity for the dwellers in the hoes were completely gone now and he set his teeth fast and mentally called himself a weak idiot for ever thinking about such people
test2341,a narrow table against the wall in two places
test2342,he went and tried to force his head through recalling as he did where that a person's head would go the rest of the body would pass
test2343,but there was no chance for his body there the would not go first.
test2344,a fellow who was shut up in prison for life might do it he said but not in a case like this
test2345,sure you've looked around everywhere boy yes father quit
test2346,i'm going home for breakfast
test2347,shall i come to father no
test2348,stop here till sir risard comes down and tell him i'm very sorry that we should have cleared out last night only a born fool saw jerry and nancy's lobster coming into the cave and
test2349,tell him not to be uneasy it's all right and i'll have everything clear to-night
test2350,the dull sound of departing steps and a low whistling sound coming down through the sky light window into the chamber where archer ray's lair lay with his heavy eyelids pressed down by sleep
test2351,what a queer dream he thought to himself
test2352,but queer for mr mister to be talking like that to andrew taylor the boy who helped the cook
test2353,and why did andy call mr. mister father
test2354,there was an interval of thinking over this nosey question during which the low whistle went on
test2355,and i'm hungry too time i was supposing
test2356,no he was not dreaming for he was looking out on the sea where a faint mist hung hungreths of smoke
test2357,what did they say false alarm tell servants they would clear all away tonight see if anything had been left about lobster boat
test2358,once out of that room he could run and by day light the smugglers dare not hunt him down
test2359,oh those bars he mentally exclaimed and he was advancing towards them well as he drew near there was a rustling noise under the window a couple of hands seized the bars there was a scratching of boots against
test2360,rain was the first to recover from his surprise
test2361,hello he said who are you?
test2362,go round and open the door i was shut in last night by mistake
test2363,i saw you last night and wondered whose boy he was
test2364,it was you father kicked for shirking and my well i hardly knew you
test2365,nonsense.
test2366,won't do. won't sit around grinning.
test2367,"think i don't know you, mr. orfer."
test2368,won't do sir quickly i know you
test2369,been playing the spy that's what you've been doing who locked you in
test2370,archie stepped back to the door listening but there was not a sound
test2371,he has gone to give the alarm thought the prisoner and he looked excitedly round for a way of escape
test2372,nothing but the chimney presented itself
test2373,a happy inspiration had come and placing one hand upon his chest he thrust in the other gave a tug and drew out his little curved dick glinted at the edge ran to the window and began at
test2374,he divided the paint and produced a few squeaks and grating sounds as he realized that the attempt was madness
test2375,the result was not very satisfactory but sufficient so to make him essay the bar of the window once more producing a grading era selling sound as he found that now he did make a little impression so little though
test2376,but at the end of five minutes he stopped and thrust back the derrick into its sheath
test2377,no i can't part with that haha! left the boyers late
test2378,well yes i'll give you a ginnie if you'll let me out
test2379,ginnies of the boy think i'll do it for her ginnies well then too
test2380,be quick. there's a good fellow. i want to get away at once.
test2381,"not you, only a sham,"
test2382,why your clothes don't fit you and your caps don't put on skirru
test2383,never mind about that let me out of this place
test2384,i told you a fisherman cried arching impatiently but trying not to offend his visitor who possessed the power of conferring freedom by speaking sharply
test2385,not you look like a wild beast in a cage like a monkey you insincere
test2386,archie checked himself and the boy laughed
test2387,it was your turn yesterday it's mine today what a game
test2388,you laughed and flapped at me when i was on the cutters deck
test2389,i say you do look like a ram just like a big monkey in a show
test2390,ram showed his white teeth as he burst out with a long low of laughter
test2391,you ropes him sent me said
test2392,why i could tie you up in a knot and leave you on the cliff any day what a game
test2393,bit of a mite fed on salt tack and weevil biscuit talk of giving me ropes end
test2394,once more will you come and let me out no
test2395,to his astonishment the board did not flinch but thrust his own arms through placing them about the midy's waist clenching his hand behind and uttering a sharp whistle
test2396,"seen good spurs last night, mister gur, hey?"
test2397,yes sir but he may turn on the cliff at any moment
test2398,"yes, been quite ready yes sir."
test2399,"that's right, of course. well alarmed."
test2400,"as soon as the signal comes, we shall push off."
test2401,awkward bit of country sir six miles round to find a place to land.
test2402,"so shall we, sir?"
test2403,you don't think mr. gearr that they would dare to harm him as he was so unlucky as to be caught
test2404,well sir said the master hesitating smugglers are smugglers
test2405,certainly sir smugglers are smugglers indeed.
test2406,"pardon sir, didn't mean any harm."
test2407,"i'm getting very anxious about mr. rouse start at once, sir."
test2408,no wait another half an hour.
test2409,very ill-advised thing to do.
test2410,that i must request that you will not make it again very true
test2411,"awkward, mister gur. awkward."
test2412,"yes sir, of course."
test2413,"say awkward in the future, not awkward."
test2414,"i mean all alone by myself, sir."
test2415,but four aren't there a public house for ten miles didn't mean that
test2416,then what did you mean speak out and don't do the double shuffle all over my clean deck no sir
test2417,hopping about like a cat on hot bricks.
test2418,now then why do you want to go ashore?
test2419,"beg pardon, didn't mean no sir, said the tossing of his forelock."
test2420,"yes sir, said the manly gentleman, shall we go at sir?"
test2421,no wait!
test2422,keep a sharp look out on the cliff to see if mr. ray is going to make signals for a boat.
test2423,he swam round walked aff and began sweeping the shore again with his glass while the master and deck exchange glances which made a great deal
test2424,at last the little lieutenant could bear the anxiety no longer.
test2425,"pump them away into that boat there, he said, and as the crew sprang in,"
test2426,now mister gur said i'm only going to say one thing to you in the way of instructions yes sir
test2427,beg pardon sir said the master deprecatingly
test2428,steady my lad steady cried the master keep stroke and then he began to make plans as to his first proceedings on getting assured
test2429,say mr. gerk said dick after one of these searches he wouldn't run away what?
test2430,mr. raystoke sir don't be a fool.
test2431,what? tracked the mummy under?
test2432,gurge glanced around to see if the men were looking and then said rather huskily but kindly
test2433,"ah, he hedgitated sadly."
test2434,say mr gurser which thankful i am for you speaking so but you don't really think he has come to harm
test2435,i hope not dick i hope not but smugglers don't stand at anything sometimes.
test2436,i do assure you there's nothing here but what you may see.
test2437,"if you let me finish you'd know, said gruff one of our boys is missing seeing him up here."
test2438,"boy about seventeen with a red cap no sir, i've not."
test2439,don't know as he's been seen about here do you said looking at her searchingly no sir
test2440,if she knew evil had come to the poor lady's face she would have told tales like print
test2441,i said a lad about seventeen and a red cap like yours said gurree shortly
test2442,the man shook his head and stared as if he didn't half understand the drift of what was said
test2443,"here, my lad, where's your master?"
test2444,"hey i say, where's your master?"
test2445,guerre turned away patiently again and signing to his men to follow they all began to tramp a steep track leading toward the hoose with the rabbits scuttling away among the furs and
test2446,i don't know what i'm under dick and men can't be sure
test2447,gurled and saluted his business while the baron who had turned sailor and more quarreled than his lord drew a breath of full relief one of his ship boys said
test2448,"all looking like a common sailor and wearing a red cap no sir, said his residant"
test2449,i've seen no one answering to the description here.
test2450,"beg pardon sir but you, as a gentleman, assure me that he is not here certainly sir is riven"
test2451,surely cried served and excitedly
test2452,whirred in silence.
test2453,lindy graham looked gassy.
test2454,you do not know no
test2455,these were soon to make trouble for me of which i had never dreamed
test2456,henry washington younger my father represented jackson county three times in the legislature and was also a judge of the county court
test2457,my mother who was brishe fritz of independence was a daughter of richard fritz who fought under general andrew jackson at new orleans jackson county having been so named at my
test2458,i cannot remember when i did not know how to shoot
test2459,my brother james was born january fifteen eighteen forty eight john in eighteen fifty one and robert in december eighteen eighteen fifty three
test2460,my older brother richard died in eighteen sixty
test2461,my father was in the employ of the united states government and had the mail contract for five hundred miles
test2462,he had started back to harrisonville but was waylaid one mile south of westport a suburb of kansas city and brutally murdered falling out of his buggy into the road with three mortal bullet
test2463,miss washington wells and her son samuel on the road home from kansas city to lee summit recognized the body as that of my father
test2464,miss well stayed to guard the remains while her son carried the news of the murder to colonel pebbody of the federal command who was then in camp at kansas city
test2465,miss mccarthy jumped from the window of the house and escaped
test2466,as the raiders left one of them shouted
test2467,now old lady call on your protectors why don't you call on co younger now
test2468,every not represented a human life
test2469,but she failed to find the comfort she sought for annoyances continued in a more aggravated form
test2470,two months after this incident the same persecutors again entered our home in the dead of night and at the point of a pistol tried to force my mother to set fire to her own home
test2471,i have always felt that the exposure to which she was subjected on this cruel journey too hard even for a man to take was a direct cause of her death
test2472,from harrisonville she went to waverly where she was hounded continually
test2473,one of the conditions upon which her life was spared was that she would be reported to lexington weekly
test2474,one of my old school teachers whom i have never seen since spring or summer of eighteen sixty two is steven b. elkins senator from west virginia

test2480,come in colonel heyes claim colonel crocker
test2481,i think he'll be rather tough meat for breakfast replied he might be all right for dinner
test2482,jackson with a party of thirty seasoned men charged the indiana guns and captured them but major foster led a gallant charge against the invaders and recaptured the pieces
test2483,we were out of ammunition and worse had the fight been pressed
test2484,they marked my clothes in one or two places however
test2485,major foster and a letter to governor jefferson in benedictine of minnesota said
test2486,i was told by some of our men from the western border of the state that they recognized a daring young rider as co younger
test2487,about nine thirty am i was shot down
test2488,the wounds of both forces were gathered up and were placed in houses
test2489,although every book pursuing to narrate the lives of the younger brothers has told of the liberty robbery and implied that we had a part in it the younger brothers were not suspected at that time nor a long
test2490,it was claimed by people of liberty that they positively recognized among the robbers all shepherd red moccasins and bug pants who had seen service with quantril
test2491,the raid was accompanied by bloodshed judge mcclane the banker being shot though fatally
test2492,no warrant was issued for the younger ones but subsequent historians have invariably at least accused us of taking part as but as i said before there is no truth in the accusation

test2496,you may use this letter in your own way

test2498,at the time of the gallatin bank robbery i was gathering cattle in ellsworth county texas cattle i bought from pleas antler and rector
test2499,this can be proved by both of them also by sheriff parkley and fifty other respectable men of that county
test2500,i brought the cattle to canada at fall and remained in san francisco county until february
test2501,i then went to arkansas and returned to saint clear county about the first of may
test2502,and went to kansas where our kennel in woodson county at colonel ridges
test2503,during the summer i was either in st. clare or kansas but as there was no robbery committed that summer it makes no difference where i was
test2504,i went through independence and from there to ace wells
test2505,there i took dinner and then went to dr. l dwymans
test2506,our business there was to see ep west he was not at home but the family will remember that we were there
test2507,we crossed on the bridge stayed in the city all night and the next morning we rode up through the city
test2508,i met several of my friends among them was bob hutchinson
test2509,we were not on good terms at the time nor have we been for several years
test2510,poor john he has been hunted down and shot like a wild beast and never was a boy more innocent
test2511,dr. ellis was his physician
test2512,there were few or hundred persons there who will testify in any court that john and i were there
test2513,heldenfickel and wife of greenwood valley were attending the springs at that time and either of them will testify to the above for john and i sat in front of mister smith while he
test2514,about the last of december eighteen seventy three i arrived in carroll parish louisiana
test2515,i stayed there until the eighth of february eighteen seventy four
test2516,i had not heard of that when i wrote the letter of eighteen seventy four and to correct any misapprehension that might be created by omitting it i will say that at the time i was
test2517,it was immediately following the rock island robbery at earl's island that their first appeared a deliberate enlistment of some local papers in missouri to connect us with this robbery
test2518,i urged on the boys that whatever happened we should not shoot any one
test2519,miller and i crossed the bridge the three were on some good dry goods at the corner near the bank and as soon as they saw us went right into the bank instead of waiting for us to get there
test2520,when we came up i told miller to shut the back door which they had left open in their hurry
test2521,j s. allison whose hardware store was near tried to go into the bank but miller ordered him away and he ran around the corner shouting
test2522,get your guns boys they're robbing the bank
test2523,and i called to him to get inside at the same time firing a pistol shot in the air as a signal to the three boys at the bridge that we had been discovered
test2524,almost at this instant i heard a pistol shot in the bank
test2525,chadwell woods and jim wrote up and joined us shouting to the people in the street to get inside and firing their pistols to emphasize their commands
test2526,if any of our party shot him it must have been woods
test2527,meanwhile the street was getting uncomfortably hot
test2528,every time i saw any one with a bead on me i would drop off my horse and try to drive the shooter inside but i could not see in any direction
test2529,dr. wheeler who had gone upstairs in the hotel shot miller and he lay dying in the street
test2530,changing his pistol to his left hand bob ran out and mounted milner's mare
test2531,what kept you so long ass pits
test2532,to the rest of the affair inside the bank i take the account of a northfield narrator
test2533,where's the money outside the safe bob asked
test2534,the shutters were closed and this cause bunker in an instance delay that was almost fatal fitch chased him with a bullet
test2535,the first one missed but the second went through his right shoulder
test2536,that night it started to rain and we wore out our horses
test2537,friday we moved toward waterloo and friday night we camped between elias and german lake
test2538,bob shattered elbows requiring frequent attention and that night we made only nine miles and monday monday night in tuesday monday night and tuesday we spent in a deserted farmhouse close to manhattan
test2539,that day a man named dunn discovered us and we took him prisoner
test2540,finally we administered to him an oath to betray our warehouses until we had time to make our escape and he agreed not to
test2541,no sooner however was he released than he made post haste into manzate to announce our presence and in a few minutes another pasha was looking for us
test2542,the whistle on the oil mill blew and we feared that it was a signal that had been agreed upon to alarm the town in case we were observed but we were not malicious
test2543,he had to sleep with it pillowed on my breast jim being also crippled with a wound in his shoulder and we could not get much sleep
test2544,but they soon after got close enough so that one of them broke my walking stick with a shot
test2545,we were inside of our long slow horses when they cut us off from the animals and our last hope was gone
test2546,six steps to the front sheriff gillespie colonel t l vault b m rye g a bradford c a pamooby and s j seaver
test2547,forming in line four paces apart he ordered them to advance rapidly and concentrate the fire of the whole line the instant the robbers were discovered
test2548,make for the horses i said every man for himself
test2549,there is no use stopping to pick up a comrade here for we can't get him through the line just charge them and make it if we can
test2550,i got up as a signal for the charge and we fired one volley
test2551,one of the fellows in the outer line not brave enough himself to join the volunteers who had come in to beat us out was not disposed to believe in the surrender and had his gun leveled on bob in
test2552,sheriff glisbon of waterloo county who was taking bob's pistol from him was also shouting to the fellow
test2553,including those received in and on the way from northfield i had eleven wounds
test2554,in sheriff glispin's order not to shoot was the beginning of the protectorate that minnesota people established over us
test2555,captain murray
test2556,but marsport had flourished enough to kill it off.
test2557,some of mars laws dated from the time when law enforcement had been hampered by lack of men rather than by the type of men
test2558,the stone wall gang numbered perhaps five hundred
test2559,even derelict and failures had to eat there were stories and shops throughout the district which eeked out some kind of a marginal living
test2560,they were safe from protection racketeers there none bothered to come so far out.
test2561,the shopkeepers and some of the less unfortunate people there had protested loud enough to reach clear back to earth
test2562,captain murdock was an unknown factor and now was asking for more men.
test2563,the pressure was enough to get them for him
test2564,"gordon reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out, mixed with a vague relief."
test2565,i've got a free hand and we're going to run this way we would on earth.
test2566,your job is to protect the citizens here and that means everyone not breaking the laws whether you feel like it or not no graft
test2567,the first man making a shake down will get the same treatment we're going to use on the stone wall boys you'll get double pay here and you can live on it
test2568,he picked out five of the men including gordon you'll come with me
test2569,the rest of you can team up any way you want tonight pick any route that's open ok men let's go
test2570,bruce gordon grinned slowly as he swung the stick and murdock's eyes fell on him earth cop
test2571,two years gordon admitted.
test2572,for a second gordon cursed himself.
test2573,he began wondering about security then
test2574,nobody had tried to get in touch with him.
test2575,there was a crude lighting system here put up by the citizens at the front of each building a dim phosphor bulb glowed when darkness fell they would have nothing else to see by
test2576,moving in two groups of threes at opposite sides of the street they began their beat
test2577,there was no chance to save the citizen who was dying from lack of air.
test2578,gordon felt the solid pleasure of the finally turned club in his hands.
test2579,gordon's eyes popped at that.
test2580,he swallowed the sentiment his own club was moving now
test2581,the other four cops had come in reluctantly.
test2582,he brought him to the ground with a single blow across the kidneys.
test2583,they rounded up the men of the gang and one of the cops started off.
test2584,to find a phone and call the wagon.
test2585,we're not using wagons mordred told them line them up.
test2586,if they tried to run they were hit from behind if they stood still they were clustered carefully
test2587,murdock indicated one who stood with his shoulder shaking and tears running down his cheeks.
test2588,the captain's face was as sick as gordon's felt
test2589,i want the name of every man in the gang you can remember he told the man.
test2590,colonel they'd kill me i don't know.
test2591,murdock took his nod as evidence enough and turned to the wretched thaws
test2592,if he should turn up dead i'll know you boys are responsible and i'll find you
test2593,trouble began brewing shortly after though.
test2594,murdock sent one of the men to pick up a second squad of six and then a third
test2595,and the third one bruce gordon spotted one of the men who'd been beaten before.
test2596,get a stretcher and take him wherever he belongs he ordered
test2597,but the captain stirred finally sighing.
test2598,no the cops are giving me they're covered gordon.
test2599,but the sternwall gang is backing waine.
test2600,but it's going to be tough on them.
test2601,bruce gordon grimmes i've got a yellow ticket from security
test2602,murdock blinked he dropped his eye slowly
test2603,what makes you think waine will be re-elected?
test2604,nobody wants him except a gang of crooks and those in power.
test2605,ever see a martian election?
test2606,no you're a foremoster he can't lose
test2607,and then hell is going to pop and this whole planet may be blown wide open.
test2608,it fitted with the dae predictions of security and what the spying gordon was going to do according to them.
test2609,he was getting even fatter now that he was eating better food from the fair restaurant around the corner
test2610,cost them more but they'd be respectable.
test2611,because izzy is always honest according to how he sees it.
test2612,but you got earth ideas of the stuff like i had once
test2613,the groups grew more experienced and murdock was training a new squad every night
test2614,it wasn't exactly legal but nothing was here
test2615,this could lead to abuses as he'd seen on earth.
test2616,but there probably wouldn't be time for it if mayorwayne was re-elected.
test2617,it was night outside and the phosphorescent bulbs at the corners glowed dimly giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the extemporized precinct house
test2618,it had probably been years since any had dared risk it after the sun had gone down
test2619,and the slow doubtful respect on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that haley's system was working
test2620,gordon hit the signal switch and the marsh speaker let out a shrill whistle
test2621,gun suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere.
test2622,"you can't do it to me,"
test2623,i'm reformed i'm going straight.
test2624,you damned cops can't no one was blubbering.
test2625,one look was enough the workpapers had the tell tale over thickening of the signature that had shown up on other papers obviously forgeries
test2626,some turned away as gordon and the other cop went to work but most of them weren't squeamish
test2627,when it was over the two picked up their wimpers and captive
test2628,jenkins the other cop had been holding the wallet
test2629,must have been making a big contact in something fifty fifty
test2630,there must have been over two thousand credits in the wallet.
test2631,when gordon and jenkins came back mordred tossed the money to them split it
test2632,"whatever comes to hand, governor,"
test2633,"like this social call, gordon asked him."
test2634,"the little man shook his head his ancient eighteen year old face turning sober no,"
test2635,"you owe me some bills, governor."
test2636,eleven hundred fifty credits
test2637,you didn't pay up your pledge to the captain's fund so i had to fill in
test2638,"a thousand interest at ten percent a week standard, right?"
test2639,gordon had heard of the friendly interest charged on the side here but he shook his head wrong as he
test2640,"hah! azzy turned it over and shook his head,"
test2641,now show me where i signed any agreement saying i'd pay you back.
test2642,for a second azzy's face went blank then he chuckled
test2643,he pulled out the bills and handed them over.
test2644,"thanks, zizzy thanks yourself"
test2645,the kid pocketed the money cheerfully nodding.
test2646,the little guy knew mars as few others did apparently from all sides
test2647,and if any of the other cops had private rackets of their own isi was undoubtedly the man to find it out and use the information with a beat such as that even going halves and with all the
test2648,the captain looked completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped onto the bench
test2649,"go on, accept, dammit."
test2650,there was a man coming from earth on a second ship who would see him
test2651,the little publisher was back at the crusader again.
test2652,only gordon and sheila were left.
test2653,credit had been established again and the businesses were open
test2654,gordon came to a row of temporary bubbles individual dwellings built like the dome but opaque for privacy
test2655,they had been lucky
test2656,shulberg's volunteers were official now.
test2657,fat's place was still open though the crooked tables had been removed gordon dropped to a stool slipping off his helmet
test2658,he reached automatically for the glass of ethered beer
test2659,thought you'd be in the chips.
test2660,that's mars gordon echoed the other's comment why don't you pull off the planet fats you could go back to earth i'd guess the other nodded
test2661,guess a man gets used to anything hell maybe i can hire some bums to sit around and whop it up when the ships come in and bill this as a real old martian den of sin
test2662,there was a grin on the other's face.
test2663,finally got our orders for you it's mercury
test2664,we sent twenty others the same way and they failed
test2665,let's say you've shifted some of the misery around a bit and given them a chance to do better.
test2666,you can't stay here.
test2667,there's a rocket waiting to transship you to the moon on the way to mercury right now gordon side.
test2668,and i paid her the pay we owe you from the time you began using your badge she's out shopping.
test2669,but his old eyes were glinting.
test2670,"did you think we'd let you go without seeing you off, caber? he asked."
test2671,"i i oh drat, i'm getting old, izzy, you tell him."
test2672,he grabbed gordon's hand and waddled down the landing plank asizzy shook his head
test2673,any castrato had begun to make prunes with lizzy
test2674,lessley determined to try for honours in english language and literature
test2675,her tastes all lay in this direction her idea being by and by to follow her mother's profession of journalism for which she already showed considerable aptitude
test2676,she had no idea of allowing herself to break down.
test2677,what do you mean replied lazily
test2678,"why will you be parting from me, you know?"
test2679,i won't be the constant worry and plague of your life
test2680,it is this if by any chance you don't leave st. wort's anny i hope you will allow me to be your room fellow again next term
test2681,said annie a flash of light coming into her eyes and then leaving them
test2682,but she added abruptly you speak of something which must not take place
test2683,i must pass honours if i don't i shall die
test2684,a few moments later they came a tap at the door
test2685,lizzy opened the door
test2686,jane harrison stood without
test2687,these letters have just come for you and any chursters she said and as i was coming upstairs i thought i would leave them with you
test2688,leslie thanked her and eagerly grasped the little parcel
test2689,her eyes shone with pleasure at the anticipation of the delightful time she would revel in the home news the other letter was directed to ady cochlester
test2690,here is a letter for annie cried lissie lissie
test2691,her face grew suddenly white as death what is this death
test2692,i have been starving or rather i have been thirsty
test2693,well read it in peace said lethally i won't disturb you
test2694,i am truly glad it has come
test2695,leslie seated herself with her back to her companion and opened her own letters
test2696,don't notice me replied any.
test2697,i must go into the grounds the air is stifling
test2698,but they are just shutting up
test2699,i shall go i know a way
test2700,just after midnight she rose with a sigh to prepare for bed.
test2701,she looked down the room
test2702,now i remember she got a letter which upset her very much and went out
test2703,leslie went to the window and flung it open she put her head out and tried to peer into the darkness but the moon had already set and she could not see more than a couple of yards
test2704,she is a very queer erratic creature and that letter there was bad news in that letter
test2705,what can she be doing out by herself?
test2706,leslie left the room but she had keenly gone a dozen places down the corridor before she met any returning
test2707,annie's eyes were very bright her cheeks were no longer pale and there was a brilliant color in them
test2708,she did not take the least notice of leslie but going into the room shut the door.
test2709,"don't begin, jenny."
test2710,don't begin what do you mean
test2711,i mean that i don't want you to begin to ask questions
test2712,i walked up and down as fast as ever i could outside in order to make myself sleepy
test2713,don't talk to me lizzy don't say a single word
test2714,i shall go off to sleep that is all i care for
test2715,"dude, sireny."
test2716,now drink this at once she said in a voice of authority if you really wish to sleep
test2717,annie stared ahead at the coco then she uttered a laugh
test2718,"drink that, she said."
test2719,do you want to kill me? don't talk anymore.
test2720,i am sleeping i shall sleep.
test2721,she got into bed as she spoke and wrapped the cloths tightly round her
test2722,can you manage with a candle just for once?
test2723,"sincerely, cedric leave"
test2724,she turned the light off and lit a candle which she put behind her screen then prepared to get into bed
test2725,annie's manner was very mysterious
test2726,and he did not mean to confine any one that night and the kindest thing was to leave her alone
test2727,tired out lizzy herself dropped to sleep
test2728,annie is that you? she called out.
test2729,there was no reply but the sound of hurrying steps came quicker and quicker now and then they were interrupted by a groan
test2730,oh this will kill me my heart will break this will kill me!
test2731,the guild of st. elizabeth
test2732,immediately after dinner that evening leslie ran up to her room to make preparations for her visit to east hall

test2734,every student is to be in an east hall at half past eight
test2735,it doesn't matter replied any whether it is an order or not i'm not coming see nothing about me please

test2742,leslie was just closing the door behind her when anne called after her

test2745,but don't lock me up please anyy
test2746,oh i won't lock you out she said but i must have the key
test2747,jean hearne's voice was heard in the passage
test2748,as she walked down the corridor she heard it being turned on the lock
test2749,what can this mean she said to herself
test2750,oh i won't press you replied jane
test2751,oh i shall never do that replied lizzy
test2752,you see all the girls except ileine and marguerite laughed at her and that seems to me to make her worse

test2779,after the address the girls themselves were encouraged to speak and a very animated discussion followed
test2780,it was past ten o'clock when she left the hall
test2781,just as she was doing so miss fraze came up
test2782,any cally chester is your room fellow is she not she said
test2783,i see by your face m'sieur roy that you are distressed about something are you keeping anything back
test2784,i am afraid i am replied lizzy distress now in her tone

test2787,the girl who breaks the rules has to be punished
test2788,i will tell her

test2790,in the government of ireland his administration had been equally promotional of his master's interest and that of the subjects committed to his care
test2791,the case of lord mont norris of all those which were collected with so much industry as was the most flamelike and the least excuseable
test2792,the court which consisted of the chief officials of the army found the crime to be capital and condemned that nobleman to lose his head
test2793,with a token by which i shall discover it
test2794,it is now a full two hundred and forty years since treachery were defined and so long has it been since any man was touched to this extent upon this crime before myself
test2795,let us not to our own destruction awake these sleeping lions by rattling up a company of old records which had been for so many ages by the wall forgotten and neglected

test2851,and intense vocal excitement possessed the players for the game was a close one and the stakes were very heavy
test2852,they bent eagerly over the board each watching with feverish anxiety his companions' movements each casting now and again a glowing eye upon the heap of gold and green barks that lay between them and at times
test2853,a deep grown startled them and they sprang to their feet pale and trembling with sudden terror each holding his breath and straining his ear to catch a repetition of the dread sound

test2891,but she fixed upon a picture which she said she preferred to anything she had seen in the gallery.
test2892,philip jocelyn was examining some pictures on the other side of the room when his wife made his discovery.
test2893,how i wish she could get me a copy of that picture of philip laura said contentedly.

test2896,they have said that he is even a little imbecile that he does not remember himself of the most common events of his life.
test2897,but there are some others who say that his memory has not altogether failed and that he is still harshly critical towards the works of others.
test2898,i don't think you will have any difficulty in finding the house.
test2899,"you will be doing me such a favor, philip, if you'll say yes."
test2900,his followers rushed forward to where he lay and their united force compelling the black knight to pause they dragged the wounded leader within the walls.

test2907,they are fast rising at least said ericara and a signal shall soon wave to warn the besieged to press hard upon those who would extinguish them.
test2908,meanwhile the black knight had led his forces again to the attack and so vigorous was their assault that before long the gate of the castle alone separated them from those within
test2909,the defenders finding the castle to be on fire now determined to sell their lives as dearly as they could and headed by the bracy they threw open the gate and were at once involved in a terrific conflict
test2910,the black knight with potent strength forces his way inward in spite of the braze and his followers
test2911,two of the foremostest they instantly fell and the rest gave way notwithstanding all the leaders' efforts to stop them.
test2912,the black knight was soon engaged in desperate combat with the norman chief and the vaulted roof of the hall wrung with furious blows.
test2913,"at length, the bracy fell."

test2915,yet first let me say said bracy what importeth thee to know

test2921,before long the tower flames had smothered every obstruction and rose to the evening skies one huge and burning beacon seen far and wide through the adjacent country tower after tower crashed down with blazing roof and raft
test2922,at length with a terrific crash the whole turret gave way and she pirouetted in the flames which had consumed her tyrant.
test2923,when the outlaws had divided the spoils which they had taken from the castle of torquilstone sebastian prepared to take his departure
test2924,he left a gallant band of foresters sorrowing deeply for his lost friend the lord of conningburg and he and his followers had scarce parted when a procession moved slowly from under the greenwood
test2925,to bracey bowed low and in silence threw himself upon a horse and galloped off through the wood.
test2926,here is a bugle which an english yeoman has once worn i pray thee to keep it as a memorial of thy gallant bearing.
test2927,so saying he mounted his strong war-horse and rode off through the forest.

test2933,he had not until then been informed to the presence of the jewish maiden in the abode of the templars and great was his fury and indignation on learning that she was among them.
test2934,poor alexis was hurried off accordingly and exiled from the precinct all his entreaties and even his offers unheard and disregarded
test2935,the assurance that she possessed some friend in this awful assembly gave her courage to look around and to mark to whom her presence she had been conducted.
test2936,she gazed accordingly upon a scene which might well have struck terror into a bolder heart than whose
test2937,at his feet was placed the table occupied by two scribes whose duty was to record the proceedings of the day.
test2938,the preceptors of whom they were four present occupied seats behind the superiors and behind them stood the acquirers of the order robed in white.
